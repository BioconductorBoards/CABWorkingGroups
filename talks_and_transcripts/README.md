## Bioconductor Talks and Transcripts ðŸ’¬

This repository aims to make the Bioconductor related videos and captions accessible, re-useable, and encourage further translation in other languages beyond English.
All original videos are available in [Bioconductor YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor).
This project is a copy of [OLS-3 Cohort Talks and Transcripts](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols3-cohort-talks-and-transcripts) to facilitate learning of Bioconductor novice learners.
