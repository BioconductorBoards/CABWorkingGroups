hello everyone i hope you're enjoying

0:00:11.440,0:00:16.080
bioc asia 2021 i'd like to thank the

0:00:14.240,0:00:18.160
conference organizers for inviting me to

0:00:16.080,0:00:19.920
speak today and while this isn't live

0:00:18.160,0:00:21.439
i'm very excited to be giving my first

0:00:19.920,0:00:24.000
keynote talk ever

0:00:21.439,0:00:26.080
my talk today is on bioconductor what

0:00:24.000,0:00:29.199
bioconductor is and how the core team

0:00:26.080,0:00:30.720
helps facilitate the project

0:00:29.199,0:00:33.200
so the first thing that surprised me

0:00:30.720,0:00:34.960
when i started going to more general r

0:00:33.200,0:00:36.719
and computing conferences was the

0:00:34.960,0:00:39.280
misconception that bioconductor was a

0:00:36.719,0:00:41.840
single r package and the bioconductor

0:00:39.280,0:00:44.640
project is much larger than a single

0:00:41.840,0:00:46.640
package bioconductor is an open source

0:00:44.640,0:00:50.000
and open development r package

0:00:46.640,0:00:53.039
repository system that focuses on

0:00:50.000,0:00:55.440
analysis comprehension and visualization

0:00:53.039,0:00:58.320
of genetic and genomic data

0:00:55.440,0:01:00.079
there are actually currently over 2000

0:00:58.320,0:01:02.320
software packages in addition to

0:01:00.079,0:01:04.239
specialized data experiment annotation

0:01:02.320,0:01:07.200
and workflow packages that are available

0:01:04.239,0:01:09.200
through the bioconductor interface

0:01:07.200,0:01:11.360
but bioconductor is more than just a

0:01:09.200,0:01:13.600
package repository system it really is a

0:01:11.360,0:01:15.360
well-developed organization and there

0:01:13.600,0:01:17.439
are many people involved with shaping

0:01:15.360,0:01:19.360
the direction of the project currently

0:01:17.439,0:01:21.119
there are three main advisory boards the

0:01:19.360,0:01:23.680
scientific technical and community

0:01:21.119,0:01:25.759
boards the scientific advisory board is

0:01:23.680,0:01:27.920
an invitation only board that provides

0:01:25.759,0:01:30.400
external guidance and oversight on the

0:01:27.920,0:01:32.320
scientific direction of the project

0:01:30.400,0:01:34.000
the technical and community advisory

0:01:32.320,0:01:35.920
boards however have open public

0:01:34.000,0:01:36.960
elections every spring for inclusion on

0:01:35.920,0:01:39.200
the board

0:01:36.960,0:01:41.439
the technical advisory board advises on

0:01:39.200,0:01:43.439
project and package level infrastructure

0:01:41.439,0:01:45.920
while the community advisory board is

0:01:43.439,0:01:47.600
really dedicated to developing enhancing

0:01:45.920,0:01:48.880
and diversifying the bioconductor

0:01:47.600,0:01:50.720
community

0:01:48.880,0:01:53.040
anyone can run for a position on these

0:01:50.720,0:01:54.799
two boards for the technical board it

0:01:53.040,0:01:56.079
may be useful to have some finer

0:01:54.799,0:01:58.159
knowledge of bioconductor and

0:01:56.079,0:02:00.399
programming or a specialized scientific

0:01:58.159,0:02:02.880
technology background but the community

0:02:00.399,0:02:05.280
board especially really wants to try and

0:02:02.880,0:02:08.160
be as diverse as possible and aims for a

0:02:05.280,0:02:10.239
mix of races ethnicity education level

0:02:08.160,0:02:11.840
and bioconductor experience so if you're

0:02:10.239,0:02:13.760
interested look for a call for

0:02:11.840,0:02:15.440
applications on the bioconductor support

0:02:13.760,0:02:18.080
site and community slack channel in

0:02:15.440,0:02:18.080
early spring

0:02:18.319,0:02:22.319
so thinking back on how this started

0:02:20.560,0:02:24.879
that bioconductor is more than just a

0:02:22.319,0:02:27.360
single package it's a package repository

0:02:24.879,0:02:28.959
and an organization but even more

0:02:27.360,0:02:30.879
importantly than that probably most

0:02:28.959,0:02:32.959
important it's a community so

0:02:30.879,0:02:35.440
bioconductor really aims at trying to

0:02:32.959,0:02:37.599
provide resources and infrastructure to

0:02:35.440,0:02:39.360
link experienced package maintainers

0:02:37.599,0:02:41.440
developers and users with the

0:02:39.360,0:02:44.000
inexperience to foster this

0:02:41.440,0:02:45.920
collaborative and welcoming community of

0:02:44.000,0:02:47.760
our bioconductor users

0:02:45.920,0:02:49.519
so how and where does this community

0:02:47.760,0:02:51.760
connect well there are a couple

0:02:49.519,0:02:54.160
different places most notably the

0:02:51.760,0:02:57.120
bioconductor support site the community

0:02:54.160,0:02:58.800
slack channels and numerous conference

0:02:57.120,0:03:00.959
workshops and training events that

0:02:58.800,0:03:03.440
happen through the year and also a newly

0:03:00.959,0:03:04.959
developed mentoring chip program and i

0:03:03.440,0:03:08.239
can just take you briefly through each

0:03:04.959,0:03:08.239
of those right now

0:03:08.319,0:03:12.159
the bioconductor support site is the

0:03:10.159,0:03:14.319
first place many users go to ask

0:03:12.159,0:03:15.920
questions and get advice on analysis or

0:03:14.319,0:03:17.040
to troubleshoot using bioconductor

0:03:15.920,0:03:18.640
packages

0:03:17.040,0:03:20.720
this support site is specialized to

0:03:18.640,0:03:22.480
bioconductor package questions and every

0:03:20.720,0:03:24.879
maintainer that submits a package to

0:03:22.480,0:03:27.120
bioconductor is required to sign up so

0:03:24.879,0:03:28.480
that if an ask question gets tagged with

0:03:27.120,0:03:29.599
their package name they would be

0:03:28.480,0:03:31.599
notified

0:03:29.599,0:03:33.519
there are thousands of users on here and

0:03:31.599,0:03:35.760
it can be a great resource to tap into

0:03:33.519,0:03:37.680
community knowledge and experience

0:03:35.760,0:03:40.480
so you can search by clicking on a

0:03:37.680,0:03:42.879
package tag or you could go to the tags

0:03:40.480,0:03:45.120
tab and search for a package to see what

0:03:42.879,0:03:46.480
already existing posts and questions

0:03:45.120,0:03:48.000
are available

0:03:46.480,0:03:49.760
if you don't see anything relevant to

0:03:48.000,0:03:51.920
what you need you can always post a new

0:03:49.760,0:03:53.280
question by clicking on the ask a

0:03:51.920,0:03:55.040
questions tab

0:03:53.280,0:03:57.280
make sure to have an informative title

0:03:55.040,0:03:59.360
and be sure to tag any relevant packages

0:03:57.280,0:04:00.720
that the question relates to in the post

0:03:59.360,0:04:03.519
tags

0:04:00.720,0:04:06.239
the body uses markdown or plain text or

0:04:03.519,0:04:08.799
html if you're having issues or errors

0:04:06.239,0:04:11.200
running code be sure to post as much of

0:04:08.799,0:04:12.959
the code example in the code section and

0:04:11.200,0:04:15.360
always include the platform and version

0:04:12.959,0:04:16.560
of r and bioconductor you are using so

0:04:15.360,0:04:17.919
we can tailor the responses

0:04:16.560,0:04:20.239
appropriately

0:04:17.919,0:04:21.840
the bioconductor team also uses the news

0:04:20.239,0:04:24.560
feature to post important announcements

0:04:21.840,0:04:29.720
for releases packages conferences

0:04:24.560,0:04:29.720
elections and other such news events

0:04:29.840,0:04:33.600
there's also the bioconductor community

0:04:31.600,0:04:35.520
slack channel and i really encourage

0:04:33.600,0:04:37.600
everyone to join the channel as it is

0:04:35.520,0:04:39.360
great for conversation there are a

0:04:37.600,0:04:41.040
number of specialized channels that may

0:04:39.360,0:04:44.639
be useful for a very particular

0:04:41.040,0:04:46.560
discussion like microbiome metabolomics

0:04:44.639,0:04:48.560
a proteomics channel

0:04:46.560,0:04:50.320
we also have channels to ask about core

0:04:48.560,0:04:52.400
infrastructure pieces that we'll discuss

0:04:50.320,0:04:54.240
a little bit later on but channels like

0:04:52.400,0:04:56.560
the bioc builds for build system

0:04:54.240,0:04:58.880
questions or biosee hubs for questions

0:04:56.560,0:05:01.680
unlike experiment hub annotation hub or

0:04:58.880,0:05:03.280
bioc file cache

0:05:01.680,0:05:05.280
there are a number of conferences

0:05:03.280,0:05:07.520
workshops and training events throughout

0:05:05.280,0:05:09.360
the year there's a bioconductor event

0:05:07.520,0:05:11.680
calendar off the main website that

0:05:09.360,0:05:13.440
anyone can submit bioconductor related

0:05:11.680,0:05:15.600
events to advertise

0:05:13.440,0:05:18.000
anyone is welcome to submit event

0:05:15.600,0:05:21.520
for inclusion on the page either by

0:05:18.000,0:05:23.440
emailing events at bioconductor.org

0:05:21.520,0:05:25.600
or we're working on a forum version that

0:05:23.440,0:05:27.600
should be available soon

0:05:25.600,0:05:29.360
minimum requirements for an event is a

0:05:27.600,0:05:30.720
relevance to bioconductor and a

0:05:29.360,0:05:33.120
willingness to adhere to the

0:05:30.720,0:05:35.039
bioconductor code of conduct

0:05:33.120,0:05:36.560
conferences are always a good time and a

0:05:35.039,0:05:39.440
great way to meet other members of the

0:05:36.560,0:05:41.199
community and network hopefully you are

0:05:39.440,0:05:43.680
all enjoying yourselves here at bioc

0:05:41.199,0:05:46.479
asia which has become an annual event

0:05:43.680,0:05:48.320
there's also the annual maine bios

0:05:46.479,0:05:50.160
conference normally held in the united

0:05:48.320,0:05:53.039
states in late summer

0:05:50.160,0:05:55.120
and the annual eurobiose conference and

0:05:53.039,0:05:57.280
the next currently one scheduled is for

0:05:55.120,0:05:59.759
march 2022

0:05:57.280,0:06:01.680
in recent years we are excited to see

0:05:59.759,0:06:03.520
initiatives in other countries as well

0:06:01.680,0:06:05.680
that bioconductor is glad to send

0:06:03.520,0:06:07.919
representatives and be a part of

0:06:05.680,0:06:10.800
the community of bioinformatics software

0:06:07.919,0:06:13.360
developers in mexico and latin america

0:06:10.800,0:06:15.280
have started organizing yearly week-long

0:06:13.360,0:06:17.600
workshops and various conference and

0:06:15.280,0:06:19.280
workshops throughout the year to aid in

0:06:17.600,0:06:21.759
development of the spanish-speaking

0:06:19.280,0:06:25.520
armed bioconnector community

0:06:21.759,0:06:27.120
and the h3a bionet and h3a africa

0:06:25.520,0:06:29.759
launched a series of workshops and

0:06:27.120,0:06:31.840
webinars to help advance the african

0:06:29.759,0:06:34.639
coding and research communities which

0:06:31.840,0:06:36.560
bioconductor took part in also

0:06:34.639,0:06:38.400
these again are just a few of the many

0:06:36.560,0:06:40.479
workshops webinars and training

0:06:38.400,0:06:42.479
opportunities launched around the world

0:06:40.479,0:06:44.800
throughout the year and we are really

0:06:42.479,0:06:47.280
excited to see that the bioconnector

0:06:44.800,0:06:51.360
community is growing and that we can be

0:06:47.280,0:06:51.360
a part of research worldwide

0:06:51.919,0:06:55.120
so those are some great resources to

0:06:53.599,0:06:56.639
connect to the community but now i want

0:06:55.120,0:06:58.400
to take it back to this slide on

0:06:56.639,0:07:00.960
organization just for a second because

0:06:58.400,0:07:01.759
we skipped over the last entry the core

0:07:00.960,0:07:03.599
team

0:07:01.759,0:07:05.680
the core team plays a vital role in the

0:07:03.599,0:07:07.680
functionality of the project it's a

0:07:05.680,0:07:09.840
small dedicated group of developers that

0:07:07.680,0:07:11.360
help develop maintain and enhance core

0:07:09.840,0:07:12.880
packages and project level

0:07:11.360,0:07:14.560
infrastructure

0:07:12.880,0:07:16.319
so what does that really mean i get the

0:07:14.560,0:07:18.000
feeling that most people think that the

0:07:16.319,0:07:20.560
core team only takes care of core

0:07:18.000,0:07:22.880
packages and package maintenance but we

0:07:20.560,0:07:24.560
really do so much more than that we

0:07:22.880,0:07:27.120
talked about bioconductor being a

0:07:24.560,0:07:28.720
project there's a lot of infrastructure

0:07:27.120,0:07:30.800
pieces that are in place to make the

0:07:28.720,0:07:33.280
project function so thinking about the

0:07:30.800,0:07:35.039
resources we just went over what core

0:07:33.280,0:07:37.919
infrastructure is involved that the core

0:07:35.039,0:07:37.919
team maintains

0:07:38.319,0:07:41.360
so first there's the main website

0:07:39.840,0:07:43.680
bioconductor.org

0:07:41.360,0:07:45.840
the core team is responsible for updates

0:07:43.680,0:07:47.440
and website upkeep there's an entire

0:07:45.840,0:07:49.599
code base for the website and the

0:07:47.440,0:07:51.120
website is regenerated about every 20

0:07:49.599,0:07:53.280
minutes to make sure that there is

0:07:51.120,0:07:55.120
constant up-to-date information

0:07:53.280,0:07:57.280
similarly there's a code base for the

0:07:55.120,0:07:59.360
support site website we thankfully have

0:07:57.280,0:08:01.680
support and help from the biostars that

0:07:59.360,0:08:03.680
our support site is modeled after and in

0:08:01.680,0:08:06.479
particular an attay that assists but we

0:08:03.680,0:08:08.800
still have core team involvement in the

0:08:06.479,0:08:10.560
upkeep and maintenance of that site

0:08:08.800,0:08:12.000
there's also monitoring and answering

0:08:10.560,0:08:14.319
questions that appear on the community

0:08:12.000,0:08:16.319
slack channels many times resulting in

0:08:14.319,0:08:18.160
follow-up and investigation of issues

0:08:16.319,0:08:20.000
comments and concerns

0:08:18.160,0:08:21.759
and many core team members participate

0:08:20.000,0:08:23.039
in presenting material for conferences

0:08:21.759,0:08:24.800
and workshops

0:08:23.039,0:08:27.039
there's also normally components of the

0:08:24.800,0:08:29.440
conference like specialized web pages

0:08:27.039,0:08:31.919
systems for hosting workshops and having

0:08:29.440,0:08:33.919
computer environments for participants

0:08:31.919,0:08:36.320
that the core team also helps manage and

0:08:33.919,0:08:38.839
facilitate so hopefully you can already

0:08:36.320,0:08:41.519
see the importance of this back-end

0:08:38.839,0:08:43.200
infrastructure so continuing on i want

0:08:41.519,0:08:46.399
to think about bioconductor from two

0:08:43.200,0:08:48.240
perspectives a user and a developer and

0:08:46.399,0:08:50.000
along the way we'll discuss additional

0:08:48.240,0:08:52.000
important project infrastructure that

0:08:50.000,0:08:54.160
the core team helps develop maintain and

0:08:52.000,0:08:57.519
enhance to try to provide a good

0:08:54.160,0:08:57.519
experience to the community

0:08:58.399,0:09:02.959
so thinking about a user how does a user

0:09:00.480,0:09:04.720
interact with bioconductor traditionally

0:09:02.959,0:09:06.959
i think most users were using our

0:09:04.720,0:09:09.360
terminal or rstudio which is still

0:09:06.959,0:09:10.560
highly popular and widely utilized but

0:09:09.360,0:09:12.240
there are also newer available

0:09:10.560,0:09:14.480
technologies and projects like using

0:09:12.240,0:09:16.080
docker images or cloud-based initiatives

0:09:14.480,0:09:17.920
like the anvil project that allow a

0:09:16.080,0:09:20.000
different user experience

0:09:17.920,0:09:22.399
for our terminal and rstudio users

0:09:20.000,0:09:24.399
there's a cram package bioc manager that

0:09:22.399,0:09:26.320
is downloaded installed from cran and

0:09:24.399,0:09:28.880
provides access to all packages in

0:09:26.320,0:09:30.880
bioconductor and crayon repositories the

0:09:28.880,0:09:33.360
anvil which stands for analysis

0:09:30.880,0:09:36.959
visualization and informative lab space

0:09:33.360,0:09:38.560
is an nhgri project it provides a secure

0:09:36.959,0:09:40.880
cloud-based computing environment for

0:09:38.560,0:09:42.640
analysis i will not go into detail here

0:09:40.880,0:09:44.800
about anvil and docker images but i

0:09:42.640,0:09:46.240
encourage everyone to attend natashas

0:09:44.800,0:09:48.560
talk where i believe some of these

0:09:46.240,0:09:50.560
concepts and resources will be covered i

0:09:48.560,0:09:52.240
will mention that the anvil bioconductor

0:09:50.560,0:09:54.160
package provides a different install

0:09:52.240,0:09:56.560
function designed specifically for use

0:09:54.160,0:09:58.640
with the bioconductor docker images and

0:09:56.560,0:10:01.600
the anvil computing space that can

0:09:58.640,0:10:03.279
provide fast binary package installation

0:10:01.600,0:10:05.440
why is this significant well some

0:10:03.279,0:10:07.839
packages require compilation which can

0:10:05.440,0:10:09.680
take several seconds package binaries

0:10:07.839,0:10:11.760
are pre-compiled allowing for a near

0:10:09.680,0:10:13.680
instantaneous installation the

0:10:11.760,0:10:15.519
limitation of binaries is that package

0:10:13.680,0:10:16.880
binaries are specific to the system

0:10:15.519,0:10:18.560
configuration to which they were

0:10:16.880,0:10:21.839
generated which is why they're only

0:10:18.560,0:10:21.839
available for use with the docker

0:10:23.600,0:10:27.680
another important concept for users

0:10:25.600,0:10:30.320
especially new users is how to find

0:10:27.680,0:10:32.000
packages of interest in bios manager

0:10:30.320,0:10:34.320
there's a function available that shows

0:10:32.000,0:10:36.000
a listing of all available packages or

0:10:34.320,0:10:38.640
you could use a search term to find

0:10:36.000,0:10:41.279
packages but that assumes some a priori

0:10:38.640,0:10:43.200
knowledge the bioc views page and

0:10:41.279,0:10:45.519
package landing pages can be really

0:10:43.200,0:10:47.760
useful for finding packages

0:10:45.519,0:10:49.600
off the bioconductor.org home page

0:10:47.760,0:10:52.160
there's a link to available software

0:10:49.600,0:10:54.079
packages this takes you to what we call

0:10:52.160,0:10:56.560
our bioseed views page and includes

0:10:54.079,0:10:59.680
software annotation experiment and

0:10:56.560,0:11:01.279
workflow packages books are coming soon

0:10:59.680,0:11:04.480
you can either search for terms of

0:11:01.279,0:11:06.640
interest like single cell or proteomics

0:11:04.480,0:11:08.640
to get a list of packages or if you know

0:11:06.640,0:11:10.880
a package name you can search for it

0:11:08.640,0:11:12.720
specifically like genomic ranges or

0:11:10.880,0:11:14.959
summarized experiment

0:11:12.720,0:11:17.200
the rank ordering is in order of most

0:11:14.959,0:11:19.120
downloaded to lease downloaded and if

0:11:17.200,0:11:21.920
you click on a package name it takes you

0:11:19.120,0:11:24.320
to a bioconductor's package landing page

0:11:21.920,0:11:26.560
the page has badges to indicate package

0:11:24.320,0:11:29.920
health and information on the package

0:11:26.560,0:11:31.600
like the description documentation what

0:11:29.920,0:11:33.360
package dependencies or reverse

0:11:31.600,0:11:35.440
dependencies there are

0:11:33.360,0:11:37.680
and in the bottom a link to download the

0:11:35.440,0:11:40.839
package directly instead of through bioc

0:11:37.680,0:11:42.399
manager access to the code base in

0:11:40.839,0:11:44.800
git.bioconductor.org

0:11:42.399,0:11:46.640
and package download statistics

0:11:44.800,0:11:49.120
probably the most helpful on this page

0:11:46.640,0:11:50.800
is the package documentation that a user

0:11:49.120,0:11:52.560
can browse through before downloading a

0:11:50.800,0:11:56.040
package to see if it's appropriate for

0:11:52.560,0:11:56.040
their type of analysis

0:11:56.480,0:11:59.839
so before switching to a developer's

0:11:58.240,0:12:02.079
point of view let's revisit the core

0:11:59.839,0:12:04.000
team and in these few concepts for users

0:12:02.079,0:12:05.279
what sort of infrastructure is required

0:12:04.000,0:12:06.639
in the background

0:12:05.279,0:12:09.279
so there's obviously some package

0:12:06.639,0:12:12.000
maintenance with regard to bioc manager

0:12:09.279,0:12:14.160
anvil anvil specific packages and

0:12:12.000,0:12:16.079
bioseat views packages

0:12:14.160,0:12:18.240
there's a concept of a daily build of

0:12:16.079,0:12:19.760
all bioconductor packages so that

0:12:18.240,0:12:21.920
they're available through the bioc

0:12:19.760,0:12:23.920
manager install function

0:12:21.920,0:12:26.560
there's generation and upkeep of docker

0:12:23.920,0:12:28.800
images so bioconductor docker images for

0:12:26.560,0:12:30.880
both release and develop branches and an

0:12:28.800,0:12:33.600
anvil specific docker image that needs

0:12:30.880,0:12:35.200
to be submitted to the anvil platform

0:12:33.600,0:12:37.680
there's also the binary package

0:12:35.200,0:12:40.000
generation for those provide packages

0:12:37.680,0:12:41.360
provided through anvil install

0:12:40.000,0:12:43.040
and then there's the website code and

0:12:41.360,0:12:45.279
website interaction so that you could

0:12:43.040,0:12:47.519
see that biosea views page and package

0:12:45.279,0:12:49.360
landing pages and the constant

0:12:47.519,0:12:51.519
regeneration of the website to make sure

0:12:49.360,0:12:53.440
that all that information stays up to

0:12:51.519,0:12:54.720
date to the latest

0:12:53.440,0:12:56.720
and then at the bottom of the packing

0:12:54.720,0:12:58.560
landing pages i mentioned it briefly but

0:12:56.720,0:13:01.600
there's package download statistics that

0:12:58.560,0:13:03.279
get calculated for each package as well

0:13:01.600,0:13:05.600
so again hopefully that you can see

0:13:03.279,0:13:07.760
while it may seem like trivial and basic

0:13:05.600,0:13:09.440
functionality that there's a lot that

0:13:07.760,0:13:11.360
needs to be in place behind the scenes

0:13:09.440,0:13:14.320
for everything to function properly and

0:13:11.360,0:13:14.320
interact properly

0:13:15.040,0:13:18.560
so the core team has a subset of

0:13:16.959,0:13:21.040
packages that are considered core

0:13:18.560,0:13:23.200
packages and core team maintained but

0:13:21.040,0:13:24.880
most of the packages in bioconductor are

0:13:23.200,0:13:26.480
community contributed

0:13:24.880,0:13:27.920
anyone from the community is welcome to

0:13:26.480,0:13:30.399
develop and submit a package to

0:13:27.920,0:13:31.920
bioconductor there are certain specific

0:13:30.399,0:13:33.760
package requirements that should be

0:13:31.920,0:13:36.160
implemented when developing and a

0:13:33.760,0:13:38.240
package will undergo a review process

0:13:36.160,0:13:40.399
once a package is accepted then it's

0:13:38.240,0:13:44.320
added to the daily builder and available

0:13:40.399,0:13:44.320
through bioc manager install

0:13:44.720,0:13:50.160
so package specific requirements can be

0:13:47.040,0:13:52.000
found at contributions.bioconnector.org

0:13:50.160,0:13:54.480
and the developer section of the main

0:13:52.000,0:13:56.240
website we are in the process of moving

0:13:54.480,0:13:58.600
information from the developer section

0:13:56.240,0:14:00.480
of the website to the

0:13:58.600,0:14:02.399
contributions.bioconductor.org location

0:14:00.480,0:14:04.399
so eventually all the information will

0:14:02.399,0:14:06.160
be in one location

0:14:04.399,0:14:08.160
but let's go over some of the key

0:14:06.160,0:14:10.000
concepts that should be implemented when

0:14:08.160,0:14:12.160
developing a package

0:14:10.000,0:14:14.720
one of the main things is reusing or

0:14:12.160,0:14:16.800
extending existing classes and using the

0:14:14.720,0:14:19.360
well-developed import and export methods

0:14:16.800,0:14:21.680
for certain data types bioconductor has

0:14:19.360,0:14:23.839
the concept of interoperability so if a

0:14:21.680,0:14:25.600
user wants to use one package to import

0:14:23.839,0:14:28.079
a different normalize and a third to

0:14:25.600,0:14:30.240
visualize the manipulation of data from

0:14:28.079,0:14:32.800
one package to the next should be

0:14:30.240,0:14:35.600
minimal if not eliminated completely for

0:14:32.800,0:14:37.760
the user so ideally the output of one

0:14:35.600,0:14:40.000
should be the input to another

0:14:37.760,0:14:42.839
this is why we like to emphasize using

0:14:40.000,0:14:45.199
or extending any of the existing class

0:14:42.839,0:14:47.360
structures another good practice worth

0:14:45.199,0:14:50.079
mentioning is the caching of web-based

0:14:47.360,0:14:52.880
data when possible this way if a user is

0:14:50.079,0:14:55.040
without internet or requests the same

0:14:52.880,0:14:57.600
file from a website or a website is

0:14:55.040,0:15:00.399
temporary unavailable they don't have to

0:14:57.600,0:15:02.320
re-download and could potentially use a

0:15:00.399,0:15:04.160
previously downloaded version instead of

0:15:02.320,0:15:06.240
having to wait for the internet or

0:15:04.160,0:15:08.000
re-download data

0:15:06.240,0:15:10.560
another good practice is implementing

0:15:08.000,0:15:13.279
unit tests it's strongly recommended

0:15:10.560,0:15:15.360
while tests can seem burdensome if added

0:15:13.279,0:15:17.680
to the development process early it can

0:15:15.360,0:15:20.000
actually aid in development so testing

0:15:17.680,0:15:21.920
for things like edge cases and having

0:15:20.000,0:15:26.000
both positive and negative tests can

0:15:21.920,0:15:27.760
ensure proper proper functionality

0:15:26.000,0:15:29.680
biggest thing that bioconductor is also

0:15:27.760,0:15:31.759
going to insist upon is a really

0:15:29.680,0:15:34.240
detailed vignette with runnable code

0:15:31.759,0:15:36.399
examples so vignettes are compiled when

0:15:34.240,0:15:39.040
built so it can also help ensure proper

0:15:36.399,0:15:41.120
functioning code but we like detailed

0:15:39.040,0:15:42.560
vignettes because ideally this gives

0:15:41.120,0:15:44.399
your users

0:15:42.560,0:15:46.160
an understanding of the package and the

0:15:44.399,0:15:48.160
unique functionality that the package

0:15:46.160,0:15:49.920
provides and these are just a few

0:15:48.160,0:15:51.160
concepts of the many that you'll find on

0:15:49.920,0:15:54.160
this

0:15:51.160,0:15:56.160
contributions.bioconductor.org page

0:15:54.160,0:15:58.000
so once a package is developed a user

0:15:56.160,0:16:00.079
then submits to the bioconductor new

0:15:58.000,0:16:01.680
submission tracker on github

0:16:00.079,0:16:03.600
there's some useful information on the

0:16:01.680,0:16:06.160
home page about what to expect and how

0:16:03.600,0:16:08.720
to submit related or dependent packages

0:16:06.160,0:16:10.560
but to submit a new issue you go to open

0:16:08.720,0:16:12.720
a new issue under bioconductor

0:16:10.560,0:16:14.079
contributions the title should be your

0:16:12.720,0:16:16.320
package name

0:16:14.079,0:16:18.639
all packages currently require a github

0:16:16.320,0:16:21.120
repository location and the link should

0:16:18.639,0:16:23.440
be updated pointing to this location

0:16:21.120,0:16:24.399
a package then is an awaiting moderation

0:16:23.440,0:16:26.079
stage

0:16:24.399,0:16:27.880
a reviewer will be assigned and the

0:16:26.079,0:16:30.000
package added to our

0:16:27.880,0:16:32.560
get.bioconductor.org location and a

0:16:30.000,0:16:35.199
build triggered on all three major os

0:16:32.560,0:16:37.519
platforms linux mac and windows

0:16:35.199,0:16:39.920
once a package is building and checking

0:16:37.519,0:16:41.839
without error the reviewer will do an

0:16:39.920,0:16:44.160
in-depth review of the package and offer

0:16:41.839,0:16:45.920
comments suggestions or request changes

0:16:44.160,0:16:47.199
consistent with bioconductor package

0:16:45.920,0:16:49.040
requirements

0:16:47.199,0:16:50.959
there's an open dialogue in the review

0:16:49.040,0:16:52.800
process open to the community and

0:16:50.959,0:16:53.839
governed by the bioconductor code of

0:16:52.800,0:16:56.160
conduct

0:16:53.839,0:16:59.759
once a package is accepted it's added to

0:16:56.160,0:16:59.759
the nightly daily builder

0:16:59.920,0:17:03.959
bioconductor uses get for version

0:17:01.920,0:17:07.079
control of package source code

0:17:03.959,0:17:09.520
bioconductor builds only from

0:17:07.079,0:17:11.600
get.bioconductor.org and users must push

0:17:09.520,0:17:13.039
changes to this location to propagate

0:17:11.600,0:17:15.280
them to users

0:17:13.039,0:17:17.839
from a few times a week to daily the

0:17:15.280,0:17:20.319
bioconductor builders will do a get

0:17:17.839,0:17:22.799
clone a version of the package and then

0:17:20.319,0:17:24.799
do an r command install r command build

0:17:22.799,0:17:26.959
and r command check

0:17:24.799,0:17:29.120
if the package installs builds and

0:17:26.959,0:17:31.039
checks cleanly and has a valid version

0:17:29.120,0:17:32.960
bump for changes the package is

0:17:31.039,0:17:35.600
propagated and becomes available through

0:17:32.960,0:17:37.440
the bioc manager install function

0:17:35.600,0:17:39.360
maintainers can find the build reports

0:17:37.440,0:17:42.080
from the main website in the lower right

0:17:39.360,0:17:44.080
corner marked build reports this page

0:17:42.080,0:17:45.120
indicates how frequently the builds take

0:17:44.080,0:17:47.360
place

0:17:45.120,0:17:49.440
if we click on browse for any of the

0:17:47.360,0:17:52.080
build reports you'll get a list of every

0:17:49.440,0:17:54.480
bioconductor package and the status

0:17:52.080,0:17:56.480
through each stage the top of the page

0:17:54.480,0:17:58.640
has a time stamp to indicate when it was

0:17:56.480,0:18:01.200
generated and each package has

0:17:58.640,0:18:03.200
information on the version git commit

0:18:01.200,0:18:04.559
and get date that the builder used for

0:18:03.200,0:18:06.640
that report

0:18:04.559,0:18:09.840
you can click on any stage indicator for

0:18:06.640,0:18:11.600
more information and results

0:18:09.840,0:18:14.160
so what infrastructure is needed for

0:18:11.600,0:18:15.600
everything just discussed for submitting

0:18:14.160,0:18:17.919
a package

0:18:15.600,0:18:19.679
well there's evaluating and updating of

0:18:17.919,0:18:21.600
the package guidelines

0:18:19.679,0:18:24.000
there's the code that interacts with the

0:18:21.600,0:18:25.840
package submission process on github and

0:18:24.000,0:18:27.520
code specific to the new submission

0:18:25.840,0:18:28.960
process on each of the three develop

0:18:27.520,0:18:30.640
builders

0:18:28.960,0:18:32.320
the core team also participates

0:18:30.640,0:18:34.480
currently in package reviews for new

0:18:32.320,0:18:36.320
submissions

0:18:34.480,0:18:38.720
there is facilitating the entire

0:18:36.320,0:18:40.840
bioconductor get ecosystem which

0:18:38.720,0:18:42.960
includes the

0:18:40.840,0:18:44.799
get.bioconductor.org main repository

0:18:42.960,0:18:47.760
location for all of the bioconductor

0:18:44.799,0:18:51.120
packages a git contributions app that

0:18:47.760,0:18:53.520
manages ssh credentials of users

0:18:51.120,0:18:55.360
get a light application that manages

0:18:53.520,0:18:57.840
which users have access to which

0:18:55.360,0:18:59.760
packages and gut hooks that respond to

0:18:57.840,0:19:01.520
different triggering events

0:18:59.760,0:19:04.480
there's also the bioconductor build

0:19:01.520,0:19:06.480
system called the bbs which is a large

0:19:04.480,0:19:08.559
undertaking of the core team there are

0:19:06.480,0:19:10.640
minimally six build machines that

0:19:08.559,0:19:13.200
require system administration and the

0:19:10.640,0:19:15.679
underlying code base on each to handle

0:19:13.200,0:19:17.919
the get clone the r command install the

0:19:15.679,0:19:20.000
r command build the r command check the

0:19:17.919,0:19:21.600
package propagation and the generation

0:19:20.000,0:19:23.760
of the build reports

0:19:21.600,0:19:25.440
and there's minimally six builders

0:19:23.760,0:19:28.000
because for both the bioconductor

0:19:25.440,0:19:30.640
release and bioconductor devel branches

0:19:28.000,0:19:34.559
we cover the three main os platforms of

0:19:30.640,0:19:34.559
mac linux and windows

0:19:35.280,0:19:39.200
so briefly i wanted to also touch upon

0:19:37.440,0:19:41.760
why bioconductor has a release in a

0:19:39.200,0:19:43.520
devel branch bioconductor is closely

0:19:41.760,0:19:46.320
associated with r

0:19:43.520,0:19:48.320
most years in spring r has a release

0:19:46.320,0:19:50.559
bioconductor then needs to update which

0:19:48.320,0:19:52.160
version of r is being used for packages

0:19:50.559,0:19:53.520
to insured continued proper

0:19:52.160,0:19:56.080
functionality

0:19:53.520,0:19:57.600
bioconductor has two releases of gear a

0:19:56.080,0:20:00.080
spring and a fall

0:19:57.600,0:20:01.919
where the devel branch is released and

0:20:00.080,0:20:05.200
becomes the new release

0:20:01.919,0:20:07.600
from roughly late april and early may

0:20:05.200,0:20:09.520
when the new version of r is released

0:20:07.600,0:20:12.000
both the bioconductor release and devel

0:20:09.520,0:20:14.559
branch use that stapled release version

0:20:12.000,0:20:17.200
of r or our patched version

0:20:14.559,0:20:19.440
in fall normally late october early

0:20:17.200,0:20:20.400
november bioconductor does a second

0:20:19.440,0:20:22.559
release

0:20:20.400,0:20:25.200
at this time the bioconductor release

0:20:22.559,0:20:27.360
branch still uses that stable rr patch

0:20:25.200,0:20:29.600
version but the devel bioconductor

0:20:27.360,0:20:31.600
branch switches to use r devel in

0:20:29.600,0:20:32.799
preparation for the next r release in

0:20:31.600,0:20:35.039
spring

0:20:32.799,0:20:37.919
having a devel branch allows maintainers

0:20:35.039,0:20:40.159
to adapt to changes in base r as well as

0:20:37.919,0:20:42.799
changes in any other dependent packages

0:20:40.159,0:20:45.840
that they may have and then have minimal

0:20:42.799,0:20:47.440
disruption or downtime to the end user

0:20:45.840,0:20:49.360
bioconductor encourage package

0:20:47.440,0:20:51.520
maintainers to enhance and make major

0:20:49.360,0:20:53.360
changes on the development branch and

0:20:51.520,0:20:56.159
restrict changes on the release branch

0:20:53.360,0:20:57.600
to minor bug corrections again also

0:20:56.159,0:20:59.600
reasoning that there would be a place

0:20:57.600,0:21:03.120
for development and potential breakage

0:20:59.600,0:21:04.960
without affecting the end users

0:21:03.120,0:21:06.559
the core team is always extremely busy

0:21:04.960,0:21:08.799
during release time and with release

0:21:06.559,0:21:10.960
related tasks it involves updating

0:21:08.799,0:21:13.440
versions of r and bioconductor on

0:21:10.960,0:21:15.120
minimumly the six builders

0:21:13.440,0:21:16.960
emailing maintainers that ignored the

0:21:15.120,0:21:19.120
build failure notifications to try and

0:21:16.960,0:21:21.280
fix their packages to avoid deprecation

0:21:19.120,0:21:23.360
and removal from bioconductor

0:21:21.280,0:21:25.760
reviewing the influx of newly submitted

0:21:23.360,0:21:27.840
packages for inclusion

0:21:25.760,0:21:30.400
fixing or modifying any core packages

0:21:27.840,0:21:33.360
that require such attention adding

0:21:30.400,0:21:35.320
release related annotation resources

0:21:33.360,0:21:37.039
creating new branches on

0:21:35.320,0:21:39.039
get.bioconductor.org for all the

0:21:37.039,0:21:41.120
packages for the new release

0:21:39.039,0:21:42.799
and collating all the news files from

0:21:41.120,0:21:45.280
packages to generate the release

0:21:42.799,0:21:47.200
announcement

0:21:45.280,0:21:49.039
there is another key infrastructure

0:21:47.200,0:21:51.120
piece that the core team maintains that

0:21:49.039,0:21:53.280
has gained increasing popularity in

0:21:51.120,0:21:55.600
recent years the concept of the

0:21:53.280,0:21:57.039
bioconductor hubs annotation hub and

0:21:55.600,0:21:59.919
experiment hub

0:21:57.039,0:22:02.880
as a brief background git does not allow

0:21:59.919,0:22:05.760
large files and our current git system

0:22:02.880,0:22:07.600
does not support get lfs which means

0:22:05.760,0:22:10.240
there has to be an alternative way to

0:22:07.600,0:22:12.400
provide large data sets to users

0:22:10.240,0:22:14.880
bioconductor insists data to be hosted

0:22:12.400,0:22:18.559
on a secure public or institutional

0:22:14.880,0:22:21.440
server like zenodo amazon s3 buckets

0:22:18.559,0:22:24.559
microsoft azure among other trusted

0:22:21.440,0:22:27.679
sites or direct access to web resources

0:22:24.559,0:22:29.120
or databases if available like ensemble

0:22:27.679,0:22:31.600
or ncbi

0:22:29.120,0:22:34.159
rather than privately hosting data on

0:22:31.600,0:22:35.760
say a github or dropbox

0:22:34.159,0:22:37.600
if you're developing a package we

0:22:35.760,0:22:39.760
encourage a discussion about data

0:22:37.600,0:22:41.120
hosting on other platforms on the

0:22:39.760,0:22:43.480
bioslee

0:22:41.120,0:22:46.799
dash devel

0:22:43.480,0:22:48.799
r-projects.org developers mailing list

0:22:46.799,0:22:51.760
if a maintainer does not have access to

0:22:48.799,0:22:54.400
such a resource bioconductor provides an

0:22:51.760,0:22:56.960
amazon s3 bucket for use

0:22:54.400,0:23:00.320
we are however actively investigating a

0:22:56.960,0:23:02.480
migration of location from amazon s3 to

0:23:00.320,0:23:04.400
microsoft azure

0:23:02.480,0:23:06.720
developers can download resources

0:23:04.400,0:23:09.200
directly from the trusted sites

0:23:06.720,0:23:11.120
but must implement a caching mechanism

0:23:09.200,0:23:13.600
in the background and we highly

0:23:11.120,0:23:15.919
recommend the bioconductor core package

0:23:13.600,0:23:17.760
bioc file cache

0:23:15.919,0:23:20.080
the other alternative to downloading

0:23:17.760,0:23:22.159
directly and implementing bios you file

0:23:20.080,0:23:24.720
cache is to list the data in the

0:23:22.159,0:23:26.640
annotation hub or experiment hub

0:23:24.720,0:23:28.880
the annotation hub and the experiment

0:23:26.640,0:23:30.960
hub are databases with references to the

0:23:28.880,0:23:33.440
external data for download

0:23:30.960,0:23:35.840
the hub interfaces provide a querying

0:23:33.440,0:23:38.720
mechanism on metadata provided at

0:23:35.840,0:23:40.320
inclusion of the data into the database

0:23:38.720,0:23:43.279
when using the hub interface for

0:23:40.320,0:23:45.600
download it already uses bioc file cache

0:23:43.279,0:23:48.320
as a caching mechanism so a maintainer

0:23:45.600,0:23:50.320
does not have to implement it themselves

0:23:48.320,0:23:52.320
the other advantage to listing the data

0:23:50.320,0:23:54.960
in the hubs is the findability of

0:23:52.320,0:23:57.120
resources outside of r or outside the

0:23:54.960,0:23:58.640
use of the associated bioconductor

0:23:57.120,0:24:00.480
package

0:23:58.640,0:24:02.720
there are bioconductor core packages

0:24:00.480,0:24:04.400
experiment hub and annotation hub that

0:24:02.720,0:24:06.480
can be queried for data of different

0:24:04.400,0:24:08.400
types or from different sources

0:24:06.480,0:24:10.799
the resources can be searched either

0:24:08.400,0:24:14.600
through a query performed within r or

0:24:10.799,0:24:16.159
investigation through the hub apis and

0:24:14.600,0:24:19.120
annotationhub.bioconductor.org or

0:24:16.159,0:24:21.679
experimenthub.bioconductor

0:24:19.120,0:24:24.159
the api is admittedly a little crude and

0:24:21.679,0:24:26.640
we are working on a revamp there's also

0:24:24.159,0:24:28.240
a shiny version to query hub resources

0:24:26.640,0:24:29.760
that has been developed and should be

0:24:28.240,0:24:32.159
announced soon

0:24:29.760,0:24:34.480
the query function in r will take a list

0:24:32.159,0:24:37.200
of terms and return resources matching

0:24:34.480,0:24:41.360
search criteria for example you can see

0:24:37.200,0:24:44.400
we queried here for ensembl gtf release

0:24:41.360,0:24:45.520
103 and homo sapiens which returned four

0:24:44.400,0:24:47.919
results

0:24:45.520,0:24:50.080
a single bracket using the ahid of

0:24:47.919,0:24:52.480
interest will give more information on

0:24:50.080,0:24:55.520
the resource and a double bracket will

0:24:52.480,0:24:57.840
download and cache the resource

0:24:55.520,0:25:00.240
the requirement to add data to the hubs

0:24:57.840,0:25:02.640
is a package that is already or will be

0:25:00.240,0:25:06.240
submitted to bioconductor that includes

0:25:02.640,0:25:08.240
an inst metadata.csv file with metadata

0:25:06.240,0:25:09.679
for the resources that will be added to

0:25:08.240,0:25:12.000
the database

0:25:09.679,0:25:14.400
and an in-script directory with files

0:25:12.000,0:25:17.120
that indicate how the data was generated

0:25:14.400,0:25:19.760
and relevant source information

0:25:17.120,0:25:22.240
the vignette creating a hub package

0:25:19.760,0:25:25.279
experiment hub or annotation hub in the

0:25:22.240,0:25:26.799
core package hub pub describes this in

0:25:25.279,0:25:28.640
more detail

0:25:26.799,0:25:31.520
other questions can be directed to the

0:25:28.640,0:25:33.440
hubs at bioconductor.org email

0:25:31.520,0:25:35.600
the hubs currently involve a lot of

0:25:33.440,0:25:37.200
interaction from the core team we are

0:25:35.600,0:25:39.600
working on making enhancements and

0:25:37.200,0:25:41.600
restructure to try to make it simpler

0:25:39.600,0:25:44.799
and easier to submit and maintain hub

0:25:41.600,0:25:46.720
data with limited core team interaction

0:25:44.799,0:25:48.960
currently when data is submitted to the

0:25:46.720,0:25:51.279
hubs a core team member will evaluate

0:25:48.960,0:25:53.600
the data and metadata provided

0:25:51.279,0:25:56.159
if needed assist with uploading data to

0:25:53.600,0:25:58.480
the bioconductor provided location again

0:25:56.159,0:26:00.159
currently that's an amazon s3 bucket but

0:25:58.480,0:26:02.320
that could change

0:26:00.159,0:26:04.640
and update the database for the metadata

0:26:02.320,0:26:06.880
provided so the metadata is available

0:26:04.640,0:26:09.279
through the query functions

0:26:06.880,0:26:12.000
additionally core team maintenance of

0:26:09.279,0:26:15.039
the hubs includes managing server code

0:26:12.000,0:26:18.159
on the amazon web service ec2 instances

0:26:15.039,0:26:20.799
that hosts the website and api endpoints

0:26:18.159,0:26:22.840
for both hubs and general core package

0:26:20.799,0:26:26.159
maintenance of the relevant core

0:26:22.840,0:26:28.960
packages experiment hub annotation hub

0:26:26.159,0:26:32.880
bioc file cache experiment hub data

0:26:28.960,0:26:34.880
annotation hub data and hubpub

0:26:32.880,0:26:36.480
so there are still other core related

0:26:34.880,0:26:38.720
tasks and infrastructure that we just

0:26:36.480,0:26:40.880
haven't had time to touch on things like

0:26:38.720,0:26:43.919
the amazon web service resources that we

0:26:40.880,0:26:45.279
utilize and the microsoft azure project

0:26:43.919,0:26:46.240
resources

0:26:45.279,0:26:48.720
but

0:26:46.240,0:26:50.480
hopefully this gave everyone an idea of

0:26:48.720,0:26:52.559
how much the core team supports in

0:26:50.480,0:26:55.840
addition to just general core package

0:26:52.559,0:26:57.600
health and development

0:26:55.840,0:26:59.440
so with that i would like to thank the

0:26:57.600,0:27:01.600
conference organizers for inviting me to

0:26:59.440,0:27:04.000
speak it really has been an honor and

0:27:01.600,0:27:06.400
thank you to my fellow core team members

0:27:04.000,0:27:08.159
i appreciate all the work and effort we

0:27:06.400,0:27:09.200
all put into keeping the project moving

0:27:08.159,0:27:11.279
forward

0:27:09.200,0:27:13.520
and most of all a thank you to the

0:27:11.279,0:27:15.279
bioconductor community bioconductor

0:27:13.520,0:27:17.679
would not be successful without the

0:27:15.279,0:27:20.159
contributions of all of you and whether

0:27:17.679,0:27:22.000
you're a first time user or a long-time

0:27:20.159,0:27:25.200
contributor we really hope that you

0:27:22.000,0:27:27.279
found a welcoming and helpful community

0:27:25.200,0:27:29.840
so please feel free to send me any

0:27:27.279,0:27:32.159
questions to my email or on the

0:27:29.840,0:27:34.480
community slack if anyone has any

0:27:32.159,0:27:38.120
