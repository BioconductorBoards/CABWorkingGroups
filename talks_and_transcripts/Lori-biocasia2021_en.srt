1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:08,400
uh welcome everyone to day two of bioc asia 
uh before we begin today uh i'd just like to

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,000
celebrate and acknowledge the traditional owners 
and custodians in the land of on which i'm joining

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,500
you from today here in melbourne australia which 
are the raundry people of the kulin nation i pay

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,234
my respects to their elders past and present and 
embrace their continued connection to this place

5
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:29,667
i'd also like to extend this respect to elders 
from other communities where people are joining

6
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:36,867
us from today sovereignty has never been seated 
this is and always has been aboriginal land

7
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:45,734
today uh we're going to begin with a couple 
of talks from the bioconductor core team

8
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:56,467
so from lori shepard and from the tisch so 
laurie's talk has been video recorded and has

9
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:03,267
japanese subtitles to enable those japanese 
speakers to follow the talk as well

10
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:12,000
and in an attempt to make this 
talk even more accessible i'm going

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to briefly switch to uh japanese uh so please 
forgive my friends pronunciation but uh

12
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,360
hello everyone i hope you're enjoying bioc asia
2021 i'd like to thank the conference organizers

13
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,920
for inviting me to speak today and while this
isn't live i'm very excited to be giving my first

14
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,400
keynote talk ever my talk today is on bioconductor
what bioconductor is and how the core team helps

15
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,240
facilitate the project so the first thing
that surprised me when i started going to more

16
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,200
general r and computing conferences was the
misconception that bioconductor was a single

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,600
r package and the bioconductor project is
much larger than a single package bioconductor

18
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,000
is an open source and open development r
package repository system that focuses on

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,480
analysis comprehension and visualization of
genetic and genomic data there are actually

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,680
currently over 2000 software packages in
addition to specialized data experiment

21
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,840
annotation and workflow packages that are
available through the bioconductor interface

22
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,080
but bioconductor is more than just a package
repository system it really is a well-developed

23
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,040
organization and there are many people involved
with shaping the direction of the project

24
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,920
currently there are three main advisory boards
the scientific technical and community boards

25
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,880
the scientific advisory board is an invitation
only board that provides external guidance

26
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,320
and oversight on the scientific direction of
the project the technical and community advisory

27
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,320
boards however have open public elections
every spring for inclusion on the board

28
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,440
the technical advisory board advises on
project and package level infrastructure

29
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,880
while the community advisory board is really
dedicated to developing enhancing and diversifying

30
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,560
the bioconductor community anyone can run for a
position on these two boards for the technical

31
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,720
board it may be useful to have some finer
knowledge of bioconductor and programming

32
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,400
or a specialized scientific technology background
but the community board especially really wants

33
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,160
to try and be as diverse as possible and aims
for a mix of races ethnicity education level

34
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,480
and bioconductor experience so if you're
interested look for a call for applications

35
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,080
on the bioconductor support site and
community slack channel in early spring

36
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,440
so thinking back on how this started that
bioconductor is more than just a single package

37
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,960
it's a package repository and an organization
but even more importantly than that probably most

38
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,240
important it's a community so bioconductor
really aims at trying to provide resources

39
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,040
and infrastructure to link experienced
package maintainers developers and users

40
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,000
with the inexperience to foster this
collaborative and welcoming community of

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,520
our bioconductor users so how and where does
this community connect well there are a couple

42
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,760
different places most notably the bioconductor
support site the community slack channels and

43
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,960
numerous conference workshops and training events
that happen through the year and also a newly

44
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,240
developed mentoring chip program and i can just
take you briefly through each of those right now

45
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,880
the bioconductor support site is the first
place many users go to ask questions and get

46
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,000
advice on analysis or to troubleshoot using
bioconductor packages this support site is

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,480
specialized to bioconductor package questions
and every maintainer that submits a package to

48
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,080
bioconductor is required to sign up so that if an
ask question gets tagged with their package name

49
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,880
they would be notified there are thousands of
users on here and it can be a great resource

50
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,120
to tap into community knowledge and experience so
you can search by clicking on a package tag or you

51
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,560
could go to the tags tab and search for a package
to see what already existing posts and questions

52
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,120
are available if you don't see anything
relevant to what you need you can always

53
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,640
post a new question by clicking on the ask a
questions tab make sure to have an informative

54
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,840
title and be sure to tag any relevant packages
that the question relates to in the post tags

55
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,360
the body uses markdown or plain text or html if
you're having issues or errors running code be

56
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,640
sure to post as much of the code example in the
code section and always include the platform and

57
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,280
version of r and bioconductor you are using
so we can tailor the responses appropriately

58
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,040
the bioconductor team also uses the news feature
to post important announcements for releases

59
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,840
packages conferences elections
and other such news events

60
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,560
there's also the bioconductor community slack
channel and i really encourage everyone to join

61
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,520
the channel as it is great for conversation there
are a number of specialized channels that may be

62
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,920
useful for a very particular discussion like
microbiome metabolomics a proteomics channel

63
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,560
we also have channels to ask about core
infrastructure pieces that we'll discuss a little

64
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,080
bit later on but channels like the bioc builds
for build system questions or biosee hubs for

65
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,280
questions unlike experiment hub annotation hub or
bioc file cache there are a number of conferences

66
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,080
workshops and training events throughout the
year there's a bioconductor event calendar

67
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,760
off the main website that anyone can submit
bioconductor related events to advertise anyone

68
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:08,520
is welcome to submit event for inclusion on the
page either by emailing events at bioconductor.org

69
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,360
or we're working on a forum version that should be
available soon minimum requirements for an event

70
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,240
is a relevance to bioconductor and a willingness
to adhere to the bioconductor code of conduct

71
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,320
conferences are always a good time and a great way
to meet other members of the community and network

72
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,120
hopefully you are all enjoying yourselves here
at bioc asia which has become an annual event

73
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,440
there's also the annual maine bios conference
normally held in the united states in late summer

74
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,560
and the annual eurobiose conference and the
next currently one scheduled is for march 2022

75
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,800
in recent years we are excited to see initiatives
in other countries as well that bioconductor is

76
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,800
glad to send representatives and be a part of the
community of bioinformatics software developers in

77
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,200
mexico and latin america have started organizing
yearly week-long workshops and various conference

78
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,520
and workshops throughout the year to aid in
development of the spanish-speaking armed

79
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:15,160
bioconnector community and the h3a bionet and h3a
africa launched a series of workshops and webinars

80
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,840
to help advance the african coding and research
communities which bioconductor took part in also

81
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,120
these again are just a few of the many
workshops webinars and training opportunities

82
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,760
launched around the world throughout the
year and we are really excited to see

83
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,360
that the bioconnector community is growing and
that we can be a part of research worldwide

84
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,920
so those are some great resources to connect to
the community but now i want to take it back to

85
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,640
this slide on organization just for a second
because we skipped over the last entry the

86
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,000
core team the core team plays a vital role in
the functionality of the project it's a small

87
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,040
dedicated group of developers that help develop
maintain and enhance core packages and project

88
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,320
level infrastructure so what does that really mean
i get the feeling that most people think that the

89
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,440
core team only takes care of core packages
and package maintenance but we really do so

90
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,120
much more than that we talked about bioconductor
being a project there's a lot of infrastructure

91
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,520
pieces that are in place to make the project
function so thinking about the resources we

92
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,920
just went over what core infrastructure
is involved that the core team maintains

93
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,840
so first there's the main website bioconductor.org
the core team is responsible for updates and

94
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,080
website upkeep there's an entire code
base for the website and the website is

95
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,640
regenerated about every 20 minutes to make sure
that there is constant up-to-date information

96
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,240
similarly there's a code base for the support site
website we thankfully have support and help from

97
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,280
the biostars that our support site is modeled
after and in particular an attay that assists

98
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,080
but we still have core team involvement
in the upkeep and maintenance of that site

99
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,000
there's also monitoring and answering
questions that appear on the community

100
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,360
slack channels many times resulting in follow-up
and investigation of issues comments and concerns

101
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,480
and many core team members participate in
presenting material for conferences and workshops

102
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,080
there's also normally components of the conference
like specialized web pages systems for hosting

103
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,760
workshops and having computer environments for
participants that the core team also helps manage

104
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,160
and facilitate so hopefully you can already see
the importance of this back-end infrastructure so

105
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,000
continuing on i want to think about bioconductor
from two perspectives a user and a developer

106
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,160
and along the way we'll discuss additional
important project infrastructure that the

107
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,520
core team helps develop maintain and enhance to
try to provide a good experience to the community

108
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,960
so thinking about a user how does a user
interact with bioconductor traditionally

109
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,000
i think most users were using our terminal
or rstudio which is still highly popular and

110
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,200
widely utilized but there are also newer available
technologies and projects like using docker images

111
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,360
or cloud-based initiatives like the anvil
project that allow a different user experience

112
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,040
for our terminal and rstudio users there's a
cram package bioc manager that is downloaded

113
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,640
installed from cran and provides access to all
packages in bioconductor and crayon repositories

114
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,600
the anvil which stands for analysis visualization
and informative lab space is an nhgri project

115
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,320
it provides a secure cloud-based computing
environment for analysis i will not go into

116
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,440
detail here about anvil and docker images but i
encourage everyone to attend natashas talk where

117
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,920
i believe some of these concepts and resources
will be covered i will mention that the anvil

118
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,920
bioconductor package provides a different
install function designed specifically for

119
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,000
use with the bioconductor docker images and the
anvil computing space that can provide fast binary

120
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,680
package installation why is this significant well
some packages require compilation which can take

121
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,760
several seconds package binaries are pre-compiled
allowing for a near instantaneous installation the

122
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,640
limitation of binaries is that package binaries
are specific to the system configuration to which

123
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,840
they were generated which is why they're
only available for use with the docker

124
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,280
another important concept for users especially
new users is how to find packages of interest

125
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,000
in bios manager there's a function available
that shows a listing of all available packages

126
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,680
or you could use a search term to find packages
but that assumes some a priori knowledge the

127
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,800
bioc views page and package landing pages
can be really useful for finding packages

128
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,640
off the bioconductor.org home page there's
a link to available software packages

129
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,400
this takes you to what we call our bioseed views
page and includes software annotation experiment

130
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,920
and workflow packages books are coming soon
you can either search for terms of interest

131
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,600
like single cell or proteomics to get a list
of packages or if you know a package name

132
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,920
you can search for it specifically like
genomic ranges or summarized experiment

133
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,240
the rank ordering is in order of most downloaded
to lease downloaded and if you click on a package

134
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,840
name it takes you to a bioconductor's package
landing page the page has badges to indicate

135
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,320
package health and information on the package
like the description documentation what package

136
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,920
dependencies or reverse dependencies there are
and in the bottom a link to download the package

137
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,040
directly instead of through bioc manager access to
the code base in git.bioconductor.org and package

138
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,120
download statistics probably the most helpful on
this page is the package documentation that a user

139
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,840
can browse through before downloading a package to
see if it's appropriate for their type of analysis

140
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,240
so before switching to a developer's
point of view let's revisit the core team

141
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,720
and in these few concepts for users what sort
of infrastructure is required in the background

142
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,800
so there's obviously some package maintenance
with regard to bioc manager anvil anvil specific

143
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,040
packages and bioseat views packages there's a
concept of a daily build of all bioconductor

144
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,880
packages so that they're available through the
bioc manager install function there's generation

145
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,400
and upkeep of docker images so bioconductor docker
images for both release and develop branches

146
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,560
and an anvil specific docker image that
needs to be submitted to the anvil platform

147
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,320
there's also the binary package generation
for those provide packages provided through

148
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,880
anvil install and then there's the website
code and website interaction so that you

149
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,160
could see that biosea views page and package
landing pages and the constant regeneration

150
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,560
of the website to make sure that all that
information stays up to date to the latest

151
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,440
and then at the bottom of the packing landing
pages i mentioned it briefly but there's package

152
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,960
download statistics that get calculated for each
package as well so again hopefully that you can

153
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,080
see while it may seem like trivial and basic
functionality that there's a lot that needs to

154
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,320
be in place behind the scenes for everything
to function properly and interact properly

155
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,680
so the core team has a subset of packages
that are considered core packages and core

156
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,320
team maintained but most of the packages
in bioconductor are community contributed

157
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,200
anyone from the community is welcome to
develop and submit a package to bioconductor

158
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,520
there are certain specific package requirements
that should be implemented when developing

159
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,840
and a package will undergo a review
process once a package is accepted

160
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,320
then it's added to the daily builder and
available through bioc manager install

161
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,160
so package specific requirements can be
found at contributions.bioconnector.org

162
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,120
and the developer section of the main website
we are in the process of moving information

163
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,480
from the developer section of the website to
the contributions.bioconductor.org location

164
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,440
so eventually all the information
will be in one location

165
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,200
but let's go over some of the key concepts that
should be implemented when developing a package

166
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,520
one of the main things is reusing or extending
existing classes and using the well-developed

167
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,280
import and export methods for certain data types
bioconductor has the concept of interoperability

168
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,640
so if a user wants to use one package to import a
different normalize and a third to visualize the

169
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,800
manipulation of data from one package to the next
should be minimal if not eliminated completely for

170
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,800
the user so ideally the output of one should
be the input to another this is why we like to

171
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,200
emphasize using or extending any of the existing
class structures another good practice worth

172
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,200
mentioning is the caching of web-based data when
possible this way if a user is without internet or

173
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:44,600
requests the same file from a website or a website
is temporary unavailable they don't have to

174
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,120
re-download and could potentially use a previously
downloaded version instead of having to wait for

175
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,760
the internet or re-download data another good
practice is implementing unit tests it's strongly

176
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,120
recommended while tests can seem burdensome
if added to the development process early it

177
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,800
can actually aid in development so testing for
things like edge cases and having both positive

178
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:14,360
and negative tests can ensure proper proper
functionality biggest thing that bioconductor

179
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,720
is also going to insist upon is a really
detailed vignette with runnable code examples

180
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,320
so vignettes are compiled when built so it can
also help ensure proper functioning code but we

181
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:31,240
like detailed vignettes because ideally this gives
your users an understanding of the package and

182
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,280
the unique functionality that the package provides
and these are just a few concepts of the many that

183
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,320
you'll find on this contributions.bioconductor.org
page so once a package is developed a user then

184
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,680
submits to the bioconductor new submission tracker
on github there's some useful information on the

185
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,160
home page about what to expect and how
to submit related or dependent packages

186
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,240
but to submit a new issue you go to open a new
issue under bioconductor contributions the title

187
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,480
should be your package name all packages currently
require a github repository location and the link

188
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,840
should be updated pointing to this location a
package then is an awaiting moderation stage

189
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,760
a reviewer will be assigned and the package
added to our get.bioconductor.org location

190
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:23,560
and a build triggered on all three major os
platforms linux mac and windows once a package

191
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,360
is building and checking without error the
reviewer will do an in-depth review of the package

192
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,560
and offer comments suggestions or request changes
consistent with bioconductor package requirements

193
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,760
there's an open dialogue in the review process
open to the community and governed by the

194
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,760
bioconductor code of conduct once a package is
accepted it's added to the nightly daily builder

195
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,320
bioconductor uses get for version control of
package source code bioconductor builds only from

196
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,600
get.bioconductor.org and users must push
changes to this location to propagate

197
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,480
them to users from a few times a week to daily
the bioconductor builders will do a get clone

198
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,680
a version of the package and then do an r
command install r command build and r command

199
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:17,320
check if the package installs builds and checks
cleanly and has a valid version bump for changes

200
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,880
the package is propagated and becomes available
through the bioc manager install function

201
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,760
maintainers can find the build reports from
the main website in the lower right corner

202
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,320
marked build reports this page indicates
how frequently the builds take place

203
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,120
if we click on browse for any of the build reports
you'll get a list of every bioconductor package

204
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,320
and the status through each stage the top of
the page has a time stamp to indicate when it

205
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,400
was generated and each package has information
on the version git commit and get date that the

206
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,080
builder used for that report you can click on any
stage indicator for more information and results

207
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,160
so what infrastructure is needed for
everything just discussed for submitting

208
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,040
a package well there's evaluating and
updating of the package guidelines

209
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,840
there's the code that interacts with
the package submission process on github

210
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,000
and code specific to the new submission
process on each of the three develop builders

211
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,960
the core team also participates currently
in package reviews for new submissions

212
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,400
there is facilitating the entire
bioconductor get ecosystem

213
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,080
which includes the get.bioconductor.org
main repository location for all of the

214
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,240
bioconductor packages a git contributions
app that manages ssh credentials of users

215
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,280
get a light application that manages which users
have access to which packages and gut hooks that

216
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,600
respond to different triggering events there's
also the bioconductor build system called the bbs

217
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,560
which is a large undertaking of the core team
there are minimally six build machines that

218
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:01,640
require system administration and the underlying
code base on each to handle the get clone the r

219
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,000
command install the r command build the r command
check the package propagation and the generation

220
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,920
of the build reports and there's minimally six
builders because for both the bioconductor release

221
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:19,560
and bioconductor devel branches we cover the
three main os platforms of mac linux and windows

222
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,480
so briefly i wanted to also touch upon why
bioconductor has a release in a devel branch

223
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,040
bioconductor is closely associated with r most
years in spring r has a release bioconductor

224
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,200
then needs to update which version of
r is being used for packages to insured

225
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,960
continued proper functionality bioconductor
has two releases of gear a spring and a fall

226
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:52,200
where the devel branch is released and becomes the
new release from roughly late april and early may

227
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,480
when the new version of r is released both the
bioconductor release and devel branch use that

228
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:04,200
stapled release version of r or our patched
version in fall normally late october early

229
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,960
november bioconductor does a second release
at this time the bioconductor release branch

230
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,440
still uses that stable rr patch version but the
devel bioconductor branch switches to use r devel

231
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,200
in preparation for the next r release in spring
having a devel branch allows maintainers to

232
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,440
adapt to changes in base r as well as changes in
any other dependent packages that they may have

233
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,560
and then have minimal disruption or
downtime to the end user bioconductor

234
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,360
encourage package maintainers to enhance and
make major changes on the development branch

235
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,640
and restrict changes on the release branch
to minor bug corrections again also reasoning

236
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,840
that there would be a place for development and
potential breakage without affecting the end users

237
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,000
the core team is always extremely busy during
release time and with release related tasks it

238
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,560
involves updating versions of r and bioconductor
on minimumly the six builders emailing maintainers

239
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,120
that ignored the build failure notifications to
try and fix their packages to avoid deprecation

240
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,720
and removal from bioconductor reviewing the
influx of newly submitted packages for inclusion

241
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,280
fixing or modifying any core packages that
require such attention adding release related

242
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,680
annotation resources creating new branches on
get.bioconductor.org for all the packages for

243
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:30,840
the new release and collating all the news files
from packages to generate the release announcement

244
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,160
there is another key infrastructure piece that
the core team maintains that has gained increasing

245
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,160
popularity in recent years the concept of the
bioconductor hubs annotation hub and experiment

246
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:51,000
hub as a brief background git does not allow large
files and our current git system does not support

247
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,440
get lfs which means there has to be an alternative
way to provide large data sets to users

248
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,840
bioconductor insists data to be hosted on a
secure public or institutional server like

249
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:10,920
zenodo amazon s3 buckets microsoft azure among
other trusted sites or direct access to web

250
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:19,000
resources or databases if available like ensemble
or ncbi rather than privately hosting data on say

251
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,600
a github or dropbox if you're developing a
package we encourage a discussion about data

252
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:33,160
hosting on other platforms on the bioslee dash
devel r-projects.org developers mailing list

253
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,440
if a maintainer does not have access to
such a resource bioconductor provides

254
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:45,720
an amazon s3 bucket for use we are however
actively investigating a migration of location

255
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:53,080
from amazon s3 to microsoft azure developers can
download resources directly from the trusted sites

256
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,840
but must implement a caching mechanism in
the background and we highly recommend the

257
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,640
bioconductor core package bioc file cache the
other alternative to downloading directly and

258
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,000
implementing bios you file cache is to list the
data in the annotation hub or experiment hub

259
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,680
the annotation hub and the experiment hub are
databases with references to the external data

260
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:23,560
for download the hub interfaces provide a querying
mechanism on metadata provided at inclusion of the

261
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:29,560
data into the database when using the hub
interface for download it already uses bioc

262
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,800
file cache as a caching mechanism so a maintainer
does not have to implement it themselves the other

263
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,800
advantage to listing the data in the hubs is the
findability of resources outside of r or outside

264
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,880
the use of the associated bioconductor package
there are bioconductor core packages experiment

265
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,920
hub and annotation hub that can be queried for
data of different types or from different sources

266
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,760
the resources can be searched either through a
query performed within r or investigation through

267
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,840
the hub apis and annotationhub.bioconductor.org
or experimenthub.bioconductor

268
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,320
the api is admittedly a little crude and
we are working on a revamp there's also a

269
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,960
shiny version to query hub resources that has
been developed and should be announced soon

270
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,840
the query function in r will take a list of terms
and return resources matching search criteria

271
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,400
for example you can see we queried
here for ensembl gtf release 103

272
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,640
and homo sapiens which returned four results a
single bracket using the ahid of interest will

273
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,160
give more information on the resource and a double
bracket will download and cache the resource

274
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,240
the requirement to add data to the hubs
is a package that is already or will be

275
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,560
submitted to bioconductor that includes an
inst metadata.csv file with metadata for the

276
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,800
resources that will be added to the database and
an in-script directory with files that indicate

277
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:06,760
how the data was generated and relevant source
information the vignette creating a hub package

278
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,000
experiment hub or annotation hub in the core
package hub pub describes this in more detail

279
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,880
other questions can be directed to
the hubs at bioconductor.org email

280
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,480
the hubs currently involve a lot of interaction
from the core team we are working on making

281
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,080
enhancements and restructure to try to make it
simpler and easier to submit and maintain hub data

282
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,160
with limited core team interaction currently when
data is submitted to the hubs a core team member

283
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,760
will evaluate the data and metadata provided
if needed assist with uploading data to the

284
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,280
bioconductor provided location again currently
that's an amazon s3 bucket but that could change

285
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,640
and update the database for the metadata
provided so the metadata is available

286
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,560
through the query functions additionally
core team maintenance of the hubs includes

287
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:05,160
managing server code on the amazon web service ec2
instances that hosts the website and api endpoints

288
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,880
for both hubs and general core package maintenance
of the relevant core packages experiment hub

289
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,040
annotation hub bioc file cache experiment
hub data annotation hub data and hubpub

290
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,480
so there are still other core related
tasks and infrastructure that we just

291
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,000
haven't had time to touch on things like the
amazon web service resources that we utilize

292
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,480
and the microsoft azure project resources
but hopefully this gave everyone an idea

293
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,000
of how much the core team supports in addition to
just general core package health and development

294
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,240
so with that i would like to thank the conference
organizers for inviting me to speak it really

295
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,240
has been an honor and thank you to my fellow core
team members i appreciate all the work and effort

296
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,280
we all put into keeping the project moving
forward and most of all a thank you to the

297
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,120
bioconductor community bioconductor would not be
successful without the contributions of all of you

298
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,000
and whether you're a first time user or a
long-time contributor we really hope that you

299
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,200
found a welcoming and helpful community so please
feel free to send me any questions to my email

300
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:34,840
or on the community slack if anyone has any
questions about this presentation thank you cheers

301
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,260
you
