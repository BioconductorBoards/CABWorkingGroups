1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,360
hello everyone i hope you're enjoying bioc asia 
2021 i'd like to thank the conference organizers  

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,920
for inviting me to speak today and while this 
isn't live i'm very excited to be giving my first  

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,400
keynote talk ever my talk today is on bioconductor 
what bioconductor is and how the core team helps  

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,240
facilitate the project so the first thing 
that surprised me when i started going to more  

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,200
general r and computing conferences was the 
misconception that bioconductor was a single  

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,600
r package and the bioconductor project is 
much larger than a single package bioconductor  

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,000
is an open source and open development r 
package repository system that focuses on  

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,480
analysis comprehension and visualization of 
genetic and genomic data there are actually  

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,680
currently over 2000 software packages in 
addition to specialized data experiment  

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,840
annotation and workflow packages that are 
available through the bioconductor interface  

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,080
but bioconductor is more than just a package 
repository system it really is a well-developed  

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,040
organization and there are many people involved 
with shaping the direction of the project  

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,920
currently there are three main advisory boards 
the scientific technical and community boards  

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,880
the scientific advisory board is an invitation 
only board that provides external guidance  

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,320
and oversight on the scientific direction of 
the project the technical and community advisory  

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,320
boards however have open public elections 
every spring for inclusion on the board  

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,440
the technical advisory board advises on 
project and package level infrastructure  

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,880
while the community advisory board is really 
dedicated to developing enhancing and diversifying  

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,560
the bioconductor community anyone can run for a 
position on these two boards for the technical  

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,720
board it may be useful to have some finer 
knowledge of bioconductor and programming  

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,400
or a specialized scientific technology background 
but the community board especially really wants  

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,160
to try and be as diverse as possible and aims 
for a mix of races ethnicity education level  

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,480
and bioconductor experience so if you're 
interested look for a call for applications  

24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
on the bioconductor support site and 
community slack channel in early spring

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,440
so thinking back on how this started that 
bioconductor is more than just a single package  

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,960
it's a package repository and an organization 
but even more importantly than that probably most  

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,240
important it's a community so bioconductor 
really aims at trying to provide resources  

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,040
and infrastructure to link experienced 
package maintainers developers and users  

29
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,000
with the inexperience to foster this 
collaborative and welcoming community of  

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,520
our bioconductor users so how and where does 
this community connect well there are a couple  

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,760
different places most notably the bioconductor 
support site the community slack channels and  

32
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,960
numerous conference workshops and training events 
that happen through the year and also a newly  

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,240
developed mentoring chip program and i can just 
take you briefly through each of those right now

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,880
the bioconductor support site is the first 
place many users go to ask questions and get  

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,000
advice on analysis or to troubleshoot using 
bioconductor packages this support site is  

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,480
specialized to bioconductor package questions 
and every maintainer that submits a package to  

37
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,080
bioconductor is required to sign up so that if an 
ask question gets tagged with their package name  

38
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,880
they would be notified there are thousands of 
users on here and it can be a great resource  

39
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,120
to tap into community knowledge and experience so 
you can search by clicking on a package tag or you  

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,560
could go to the tags tab and search for a package 
to see what already existing posts and questions  

41
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,120
are available if you don't see anything 
relevant to what you need you can always  

42
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,640
post a new question by clicking on the ask a 
questions tab make sure to have an informative  

43
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,840
title and be sure to tag any relevant packages 
that the question relates to in the post tags  

44
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,360
the body uses markdown or plain text or html if 
you're having issues or errors running code be  

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,640
sure to post as much of the code example in the 
code section and always include the platform and  

46
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,280
version of r and bioconductor you are using 
so we can tailor the responses appropriately  

47
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,040
the bioconductor team also uses the news feature 
to post important announcements for releases  

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,840
packages conferences elections 
and other such news events

49
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,560
there's also the bioconductor community slack 
channel and i really encourage everyone to join  

50
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,520
the channel as it is great for conversation there 
are a number of specialized channels that may be  

51
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,920
useful for a very particular discussion like 
microbiome metabolomics a proteomics channel  

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
we also have channels to ask about core 
infrastructure pieces that we'll discuss a little  

53
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,080
bit later on but channels like the bioc builds 
for build system questions or biosee hubs for  

54
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,280
questions unlike experiment hub annotation hub or 
bioc file cache there are a number of conferences  

55
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,080
workshops and training events throughout the 
year there's a bioconductor event calendar  

56
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,760
off the main website that anyone can submit 
bioconductor related events to advertise anyone  

57
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:21,520
is welcome to submit event for inclusion on the 
page either by emailing events at bioconductor.org  

58
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,360
or we're working on a forum version that should be 
available soon minimum requirements for an event  

59
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,240
is a relevance to bioconductor and a willingness 
to adhere to the bioconductor code of conduct  

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,320
conferences are always a good time and a great way 
to meet other members of the community and network  

61
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,120
hopefully you are all enjoying yourselves here 
at bioc asia which has become an annual event  

62
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,440
there's also the annual maine bios conference 
normally held in the united states in late summer  

63
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,560
and the annual eurobiose conference and the 
next currently one scheduled is for march 2022  

64
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,800
in recent years we are excited to see initiatives 
in other countries as well that bioconductor is  

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,800
glad to send representatives and be a part of the 
community of bioinformatics software developers in  

66
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,200
mexico and latin america have started organizing 
yearly week-long workshops and various conference  

67
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,520
and workshops throughout the year to aid in 
development of the spanish-speaking armed  

68
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:28,160
bioconnector community and the h3a bionet and h3a 
africa launched a series of workshops and webinars  

69
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,840
to help advance the african coding and research 
communities which bioconductor took part in also  

70
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,120
these again are just a few of the many 
workshops webinars and training opportunities  

71
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,760
launched around the world throughout the 
year and we are really excited to see  

72
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,360
that the bioconnector community is growing and 
that we can be a part of research worldwide

73
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,920
so those are some great resources to connect to 
the community but now i want to take it back to  

74
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,640
this slide on organization just for a second 
because we skipped over the last entry the  

75
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,000
core team the core team plays a vital role in 
the functionality of the project it's a small  

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,040
dedicated group of developers that help develop 
maintain and enhance core packages and project  

77
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,320
level infrastructure so what does that really mean 
i get the feeling that most people think that the  

78
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,440
core team only takes care of core packages 
and package maintenance but we really do so  

79
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,120
much more than that we talked about bioconductor 
being a project there's a lot of infrastructure  

80
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,520
pieces that are in place to make the project 
function so thinking about the resources we  

81
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,920
just went over what core infrastructure 
is involved that the core team maintains

82
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,840
so first there's the main website bioconductor.org 
the core team is responsible for updates and  

83
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,080
website upkeep there's an entire code 
base for the website and the website is  

84
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,640
regenerated about every 20 minutes to make sure 
that there is constant up-to-date information  

85
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,240
similarly there's a code base for the support site 
website we thankfully have support and help from  

86
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,280
the biostars that our support site is modeled 
after and in particular an attay that assists  

87
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,080
but we still have core team involvement 
in the upkeep and maintenance of that site  

88
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
there's also monitoring and answering 
questions that appear on the community  

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,360
slack channels many times resulting in follow-up 
and investigation of issues comments and concerns  

90
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,480
and many core team members participate in 
presenting material for conferences and workshops  

91
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,080
there's also normally components of the conference 
like specialized web pages systems for hosting  

92
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,760
workshops and having computer environments for 
participants that the core team also helps manage  

93
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,160
and facilitate so hopefully you can already see 
the importance of this back-end infrastructure so  

94
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,000
continuing on i want to think about bioconductor 
from two perspectives a user and a developer  

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,160
and along the way we'll discuss additional 
important project infrastructure that the  

96
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,520
core team helps develop maintain and enhance to 
try to provide a good experience to the community

97
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,960
so thinking about a user how does a user 
interact with bioconductor traditionally  

98
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,000
i think most users were using our terminal 
or rstudio which is still highly popular and  

99
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,200
widely utilized but there are also newer available 
technologies and projects like using docker images  

100
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
or cloud-based initiatives like the anvil 
project that allow a different user experience  

101
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,040
for our terminal and rstudio users there's a 
cram package bioc manager that is downloaded  

102
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,640
installed from cran and provides access to all 
packages in bioconductor and crayon repositories  

103
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,600
the anvil which stands for analysis visualization 
and informative lab space is an nhgri project  

104
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,320
it provides a secure cloud-based computing 
environment for analysis i will not go into  

105
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,440
detail here about anvil and docker images but i 
encourage everyone to attend natashas talk where  

106
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,920
i believe some of these concepts and resources 
will be covered i will mention that the anvil  

107
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,920
bioconductor package provides a different 
install function designed specifically for  

108
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,000
use with the bioconductor docker images and the 
anvil computing space that can provide fast binary  

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,680
package installation why is this significant well 
some packages require compilation which can take  

110
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,760
several seconds package binaries are pre-compiled 
allowing for a near instantaneous installation the  

111
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,640
limitation of binaries is that package binaries 
are specific to the system configuration to which  

112
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,840
they were generated which is why they're 
only available for use with the docker

113
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,280
another important concept for users especially 
new users is how to find packages of interest  

114
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,000
in bios manager there's a function available 
that shows a listing of all available packages  

115
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,680
or you could use a search term to find packages 
but that assumes some a priori knowledge the  

116
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,800
bioc views page and package landing pages 
can be really useful for finding packages  

117
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,640
off the bioconductor.org home page there's 
a link to available software packages  

118
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,400
this takes you to what we call our bioseed views 
page and includes software annotation experiment  

119
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,920
and workflow packages books are coming soon 
you can either search for terms of interest  

120
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,600
like single cell or proteomics to get a list 
of packages or if you know a package name  

121
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,920
you can search for it specifically like 
genomic ranges or summarized experiment  

122
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,240
the rank ordering is in order of most downloaded 
to lease downloaded and if you click on a package  

123
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,840
name it takes you to a bioconductor's package 
landing page the page has badges to indicate  

124
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,320
package health and information on the package 
like the description documentation what package  

125
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,920
dependencies or reverse dependencies there are 
and in the bottom a link to download the package  

126
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,040
directly instead of through bioc manager access to 
the code base in git.bioconductor.org and package  

127
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,120
download statistics probably the most helpful on 
this page is the package documentation that a user  

128
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,840
can browse through before downloading a package to 
see if it's appropriate for their type of analysis

129
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,240
so before switching to a developer's 
point of view let's revisit the core team  

130
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,720
and in these few concepts for users what sort 
of infrastructure is required in the background  

131
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,800
so there's obviously some package maintenance 
with regard to bioc manager anvil anvil specific  

132
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,040
packages and bioseat views packages there's a 
concept of a daily build of all bioconductor  

133
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,880
packages so that they're available through the 
bioc manager install function there's generation  

134
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,400
and upkeep of docker images so bioconductor docker 
images for both release and develop branches  

135
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,560
and an anvil specific docker image that 
needs to be submitted to the anvil platform  

136
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,320
there's also the binary package generation 
for those provide packages provided through  

137
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,880
anvil install and then there's the website 
code and website interaction so that you  

138
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,160
could see that biosea views page and package 
landing pages and the constant regeneration  

139
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,560
of the website to make sure that all that 
information stays up to date to the latest  

140
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,440
and then at the bottom of the packing landing 
pages i mentioned it briefly but there's package  

141
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,960
download statistics that get calculated for each 
package as well so again hopefully that you can  

142
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,080
see while it may seem like trivial and basic 
functionality that there's a lot that needs to  

143
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,320
be in place behind the scenes for everything 
to function properly and interact properly

144
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,680
so the core team has a subset of packages 
that are considered core packages and core  

145
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,320
team maintained but most of the packages 
in bioconductor are community contributed  

146
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,200
anyone from the community is welcome to 
develop and submit a package to bioconductor  

147
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,520
there are certain specific package requirements 
that should be implemented when developing  

148
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,840
and a package will undergo a review 
process once a package is accepted  

149
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,320
then it's added to the daily builder and 
available through bioc manager install

150
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,160
so package specific requirements can be 
found at contributions.bioconnector.org  

151
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,120
and the developer section of the main website 
we are in the process of moving information  

152
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,480
from the developer section of the website to 
the contributions.bioconductor.org location  

153
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,440
so eventually all the information 
will be in one location  

154
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,200
but let's go over some of the key concepts that 
should be implemented when developing a package  

155
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,520
one of the main things is reusing or extending 
existing classes and using the well-developed  

156
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,280
import and export methods for certain data types 
bioconductor has the concept of interoperability  

157
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,640
so if a user wants to use one package to import a 
different normalize and a third to visualize the  

158
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,800
manipulation of data from one package to the next 
should be minimal if not eliminated completely for  

159
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,800
the user so ideally the output of one should 
be the input to another this is why we like to  

160
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,200
emphasize using or extending any of the existing 
class structures another good practice worth  

161
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,200
mentioning is the caching of web-based data when 
possible this way if a user is without internet or  

162
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,600
requests the same file from a website or a website 
is temporary unavailable they don't have to  

163
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,120
re-download and could potentially use a previously 
downloaded version instead of having to wait for  

164
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,760
the internet or re-download data another good 
practice is implementing unit tests it's strongly  

165
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,120
recommended while tests can seem burdensome 
if added to the development process early it  

166
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,800
can actually aid in development so testing for 
things like edge cases and having both positive  

167
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,360
and negative tests can ensure proper proper 
functionality biggest thing that bioconductor  

168
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,720
is also going to insist upon is a really 
detailed vignette with runnable code examples  

169
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,320
so vignettes are compiled when built so it can 
also help ensure proper functioning code but we  

170
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,240
like detailed vignettes because ideally this gives 
your users an understanding of the package and  

171
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,280
the unique functionality that the package provides 
and these are just a few concepts of the many that  

172
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:56,320
you'll find on this contributions.bioconductor.org 
page so once a package is developed a user then  

173
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,680
submits to the bioconductor new submission tracker 
on github there's some useful information on the  

174
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,160
home page about what to expect and how 
to submit related or dependent packages  

175
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,240
but to submit a new issue you go to open a new 
issue under bioconductor contributions the title  

176
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,480
should be your package name all packages currently 
require a github repository location and the link  

177
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,840
should be updated pointing to this location a 
package then is an awaiting moderation stage  

178
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,760
a reviewer will be assigned and the package 
added to our get.bioconductor.org location  

179
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:36,560
and a build triggered on all three major os 
platforms linux mac and windows once a package  

180
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,360
is building and checking without error the 
reviewer will do an in-depth review of the package  

181
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,560
and offer comments suggestions or request changes 
consistent with bioconductor package requirements  

182
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,760
there's an open dialogue in the review process 
open to the community and governed by the  

183
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,760
bioconductor code of conduct once a package is 
accepted it's added to the nightly daily builder

184
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,320
bioconductor uses get for version control of 
package source code bioconductor builds only from  

185
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,600
get.bioconductor.org and users must push 
changes to this location to propagate  

186
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:18,480
them to users from a few times a week to daily 
the bioconductor builders will do a get clone  

187
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,680
a version of the package and then do an r 
command install r command build and r command  

188
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,320
check if the package installs builds and checks 
cleanly and has a valid version bump for changes  

189
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,880
the package is propagated and becomes available 
through the bioc manager install function  

190
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,760
maintainers can find the build reports from 
the main website in the lower right corner  

191
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,320
marked build reports this page indicates 
how frequently the builds take place  

192
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,120
if we click on browse for any of the build reports 
you'll get a list of every bioconductor package  

193
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,320
and the status through each stage the top of 
the page has a time stamp to indicate when it  

194
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,400
was generated and each package has information 
on the version git commit and get date that the  

195
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,080
builder used for that report you can click on any 
stage indicator for more information and results  

196
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,160
so what infrastructure is needed for 
everything just discussed for submitting  

197
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,040
a package well there's evaluating and 
updating of the package guidelines  

198
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,840
there's the code that interacts with 
the package submission process on github  

199
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,000
and code specific to the new submission 
process on each of the three develop builders  

200
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
the core team also participates currently 
in package reviews for new submissions  

201
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,400
there is facilitating the entire 
bioconductor get ecosystem  

202
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,080
which includes the get.bioconductor.org 
main repository location for all of the  

203
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,240
bioconductor packages a git contributions 
app that manages ssh credentials of users  

204
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,280
get a light application that manages which users 
have access to which packages and gut hooks that  

205
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,600
respond to different triggering events there's 
also the bioconductor build system called the bbs  

206
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,560
which is a large undertaking of the core team 
there are minimally six build machines that  

207
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,640
require system administration and the underlying 
code base on each to handle the get clone the r  

208
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,000
command install the r command build the r command 
check the package propagation and the generation  

209
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,920
of the build reports and there's minimally six 
builders because for both the bioconductor release  

210
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,560
and bioconductor devel branches we cover the 
three main os platforms of mac linux and windows

211
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,480
so briefly i wanted to also touch upon why 
bioconductor has a release in a devel branch  

212
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,040
bioconductor is closely associated with r most 
years in spring r has a release bioconductor  

213
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,200
then needs to update which version of 
r is being used for packages to insured  

214
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,960
continued proper functionality bioconductor 
has two releases of gear a spring and a fall  

215
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:05,200
where the devel branch is released and becomes the 
new release from roughly late april and early may  

216
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,480
when the new version of r is released both the 
bioconductor release and devel branch use that  

217
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,200
stapled release version of r or our patched 
version in fall normally late october early  

218
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,960
november bioconductor does a second release 
at this time the bioconductor release branch  

219
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,440
still uses that stable rr patch version but the 
devel bioconductor branch switches to use r devel  

220
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,200
in preparation for the next r release in spring 
having a devel branch allows maintainers to  

221
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,440
adapt to changes in base r as well as changes in 
any other dependent packages that they may have  

222
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,560
and then have minimal disruption or 
downtime to the end user bioconductor  

223
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,360
encourage package maintainers to enhance and 
make major changes on the development branch  

224
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,640
and restrict changes on the release branch 
to minor bug corrections again also reasoning  

225
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,840
that there would be a place for development and 
potential breakage without affecting the end users  

226
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,000
the core team is always extremely busy during 
release time and with release related tasks it  

227
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,560
involves updating versions of r and bioconductor 
on minimumly the six builders emailing maintainers  

228
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,120
that ignored the build failure notifications to 
try and fix their packages to avoid deprecation  

229
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,720
and removal from bioconductor reviewing the 
influx of newly submitted packages for inclusion  

230
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,280
fixing or modifying any core packages that 
require such attention adding release related  

231
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,680
annotation resources creating new branches on 
get.bioconductor.org for all the packages for  

232
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,840
the new release and collating all the news files 
from packages to generate the release announcement  

233
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,160
there is another key infrastructure piece that 
the core team maintains that has gained increasing  

234
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,160
popularity in recent years the concept of the 
bioconductor hubs annotation hub and experiment  

235
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:04,000
hub as a brief background git does not allow large 
files and our current git system does not support  

236
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,440
get lfs which means there has to be an alternative 
way to provide large data sets to users  

237
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,840
bioconductor insists data to be hosted on a 
secure public or institutional server like  

238
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:23,920
zenodo amazon s3 buckets microsoft azure among 
other trusted sites or direct access to web  

239
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:32,000
resources or databases if available like ensemble 
or ncbi rather than privately hosting data on say  

240
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,600
a github or dropbox if you're developing a 
package we encourage a discussion about data  

241
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:46,160
hosting on other platforms on the bioslee dash 
devel r-projects.org developers mailing list  

242
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,440
if a maintainer does not have access to 
such a resource bioconductor provides  

243
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,720
an amazon s3 bucket for use we are however 
actively investigating a migration of location  

244
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:06,080
from amazon s3 to microsoft azure developers can 
download resources directly from the trusted sites  

245
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,840
but must implement a caching mechanism in 
the background and we highly recommend the  

246
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,640
bioconductor core package bioc file cache the 
other alternative to downloading directly and  

247
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,000
implementing bios you file cache is to list the 
data in the annotation hub or experiment hub  

248
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,680
the annotation hub and the experiment hub are 
databases with references to the external data  

249
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:36,560
for download the hub interfaces provide a querying 
mechanism on metadata provided at inclusion of the  

250
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,560
data into the database when using the hub 
interface for download it already uses bioc  

251
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,800
file cache as a caching mechanism so a maintainer 
does not have to implement it themselves the other  

252
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,800
advantage to listing the data in the hubs is the 
findability of resources outside of r or outside  

253
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,880
the use of the associated bioconductor package 
there are bioconductor core packages experiment  

254
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,920
hub and annotation hub that can be queried for 
data of different types or from different sources  

255
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,760
the resources can be searched either through a 
query performed within r or investigation through  

256
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,840
the hub apis and annotationhub.bioconductor.org 
or experimenthub.bioconductor  

257
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,320
the api is admittedly a little crude and 
we are working on a revamp there's also a  

258
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,960
shiny version to query hub resources that has 
been developed and should be announced soon  

259
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,840
the query function in r will take a list of terms 
and return resources matching search criteria  

260
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,400
for example you can see we queried 
here for ensembl gtf release 103  

261
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,640
and homo sapiens which returned four results a 
single bracket using the ahid of interest will  

262
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,160
give more information on the resource and a double 
bracket will download and cache the resource  

263
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,240
the requirement to add data to the hubs 
is a package that is already or will be  

264
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,560
submitted to bioconductor that includes an 
inst metadata.csv file with metadata for the  

265
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,800
resources that will be added to the database and 
an in-script directory with files that indicate  

266
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:19,760
how the data was generated and relevant source 
information the vignette creating a hub package  

267
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,000
experiment hub or annotation hub in the core 
package hub pub describes this in more detail  

268
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,880
other questions can be directed to 
the hubs at bioconductor.org email  

269
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,480
the hubs currently involve a lot of interaction 
from the core team we are working on making  

270
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,080
enhancements and restructure to try to make it 
simpler and easier to submit and maintain hub data  

271
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,160
with limited core team interaction currently when 
data is submitted to the hubs a core team member  

272
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,760
will evaluate the data and metadata provided 
if needed assist with uploading data to the  

273
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,280
bioconductor provided location again currently 
that's an amazon s3 bucket but that could change  

274
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,640
and update the database for the metadata 
provided so the metadata is available  

275
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,560
through the query functions additionally 
core team maintenance of the hubs includes  

276
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:18,160
managing server code on the amazon web service ec2 
instances that hosts the website and api endpoints  

277
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:24,880
for both hubs and general core package maintenance 
of the relevant core packages experiment hub  

278
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,040
annotation hub bioc file cache experiment 
hub data annotation hub data and hubpub  

279
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,480
so there are still other core related 
tasks and infrastructure that we just  

280
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,000
haven't had time to touch on things like the 
amazon web service resources that we utilize  

281
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,480
and the microsoft azure project resources 
but hopefully this gave everyone an idea  

282
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,000
of how much the core team supports in addition to 
just general core package health and development  

283
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,240
so with that i would like to thank the conference 
organizers for inviting me to speak it really  

284
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,240
has been an honor and thank you to my fellow core 
team members i appreciate all the work and effort  

285
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,280
we all put into keeping the project moving 
forward and most of all a thank you to the  

286
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:17,120
bioconductor community bioconductor would not be 
successful without the contributions of all of you  

287
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,000
and whether you're a first time user or a 
long-time contributor we really hope that you  

288
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,200
found a welcoming and helpful community so please 
feel free to send me any questions to my email  

289
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:47,840
or on the community slack if anyone has any 
questions about this presentation thank you cheers

290
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,260
you
