00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
hello everyone i hope you're enjoying

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,080
bioc asia 2021 i'd like to thank the

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,160
conference organizers for inviting me to

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,920
speak today and while this isn't live

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,439
i'm very excited to be giving my first

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000
keynote talk ever

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,080
my talk today is on bioconductor what

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,199
bioconductor is and how the core team

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,720
helps facilitate the project

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,200
so the first thing that surprised me

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,960
when i started going to more general r

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
and computing conferences was the

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,280
misconception that bioconductor was a

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,840
single r package and the bioconductor

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,640
project is much larger than a single

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,640
package bioconductor is an open source

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,000
and open development r package

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,039
repository system that focuses on

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,440
analysis comprehension and visualization

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
of genetic and genomic data

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,079
there are actually currently over 2000

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,320
software packages in addition to

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,239
specialized data experiment annotation

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,200
and workflow packages that are available

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,200
through the bioconductor interface

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,360
but bioconductor is more than just a

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
package repository system it really is a

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,360
well-developed organization and there

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,439
are many people involved with shaping

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,360
the direction of the project currently

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,119
there are three main advisory boards the

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,680
scientific technical and community

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,759
boards the scientific advisory board is

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,920
an invitation only board that provides

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,400
external guidance and oversight on the

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
scientific direction of the project

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,000
the technical and community advisory

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
boards however have open public

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,960
elections every spring for inclusion on

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,200
the board

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,439
the technical advisory board advises on

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,439
project and package level infrastructure

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,920
while the community advisory board is

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,600
really dedicated to developing enhancing

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,880
and diversifying the bioconductor

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,720
community

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,040
anyone can run for a position on these

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,799
two boards for the technical board it

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,079
may be useful to have some finer

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,159
knowledge of bioconductor and

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,399
programming or a specialized scientific

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,880
technology background but the community

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,280
board especially really wants to try and

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,160
be as diverse as possible and aims for a

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,239
mix of races ethnicity education level

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,840
and bioconductor experience so if you're

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,760
interested look for a call for

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,440
applications on the bioconductor support

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,080
site and community slack channel in

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,080
early spring

61
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,319
so thinking back on how this started

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,879
that bioconductor is more than just a

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,360
single package it's a package repository

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,959
and an organization but even more

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,879
importantly than that probably most

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
important it's a community so

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,440
bioconductor really aims at trying to

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,599
provide resources and infrastructure to

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
link experienced package maintainers

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,440
developers and users with the

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,000
inexperience to foster this

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,920
collaborative and welcoming community of

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,760
our bioconductor users

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,519
so how and where does this community

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,760
connect well there are a couple

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,160
different places most notably the

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,120
bioconductor support site the community

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,800
slack channels and numerous conference

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
workshops and training events that

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
happen through the year and also a newly

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,959
developed mentoring chip program and i

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,239
can just take you briefly through each

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,239
of those right now

84
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
the bioconductor support site is the

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,319
first place many users go to ask

86
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,920
questions and get advice on analysis or

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,040
to troubleshoot using bioconductor

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
packages

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,720
this support site is specialized to

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,480
bioconductor package questions and every

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,879
maintainer that submits a package to

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,120
bioconductor is required to sign up so

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,480
that if an ask question gets tagged with

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
their package name they would be

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,599
notified

96
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,519
there are thousands of users on here and

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,760
it can be a great resource to tap into

98
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,680
community knowledge and experience

99
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,480
so you can search by clicking on a

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,879
package tag or you could go to the tags

101
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,120
tab and search for a package to see what

102
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,480
already existing posts and questions

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
are available

104
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,760
if you don't see anything relevant to

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,920
what you need you can always post a new

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
question by clicking on the ask a

107
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,040
questions tab

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
make sure to have an informative title

109
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,360
and be sure to tag any relevant packages

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,720
that the question relates to in the post

111
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
tags

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,239
the body uses markdown or plain text or

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
html if you're having issues or errors

114
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,200
running code be sure to post as much of

115
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,959
the code example in the code section and

116
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,360
always include the platform and version

117
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,560
of r and bioconductor you are using so

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,919
we can tailor the responses

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,239
appropriately

120
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,840
the bioconductor team also uses the news

121
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,560
feature to post important announcements

122
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,720
for releases packages conferences

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,720
elections and other such news events

124
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,600
there's also the bioconductor community

125
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
slack channel and i really encourage

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
everyone to join the channel as it is

127
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,360
great for conversation there are a

128
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
number of specialized channels that may

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,639
be useful for a very particular

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,560
discussion like microbiome metabolomics

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
a proteomics channel

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,320
we also have channels to ask about core

133
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,400
infrastructure pieces that we'll discuss

134
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,240
a little bit later on but channels like

135
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,560
the bioc builds for build system

136
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,880
questions or biosee hubs for questions

137
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,680
unlike experiment hub annotation hub or

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,280
bioc file cache

139
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,280
there are a number of conferences

140
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,520
workshops and training events throughout

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,360
the year there's a bioconductor event

142
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,680
calendar off the main website that

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,440
anyone can submit bioconductor related

144
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
events to advertise

145
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,000
anyone is welcome to submit event

146
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,520
for inclusion on the page either by

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,440
emailing events at bioconductor.org

148
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,600
or we're working on a forum version that

149
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,600
should be available soon

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,360
minimum requirements for an event is a

151
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,720
relevance to bioconductor and a

152
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,120
willingness to adhere to the

153
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,039
bioconductor code of conduct

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
conferences are always a good time and a

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,440
great way to meet other members of the

156
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,199
community and network hopefully you are

157
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,680
all enjoying yourselves here at bioc

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,479
asia which has become an annual event

159
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,320
there's also the annual maine bios

160
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,160
conference normally held in the united

161
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,039
states in late summer

162
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,120
and the annual eurobiose conference and

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,280
the next currently one scheduled is for

164
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,759
march 2022

165
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,680
in recent years we are excited to see

166
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,520
initiatives in other countries as well

167
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,680
that bioconductor is glad to send

168
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,919
representatives and be a part of

169
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,800
the community of bioinformatics software

170
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,360
developers in mexico and latin america

171
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,280
have started organizing yearly week-long

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,600
workshops and various conference and

173
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,280
workshops throughout the year to aid in

174
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,759
development of the spanish-speaking

175
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,520
armed bioconnector community

176
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,120
and the h3a bionet and h3a africa

177
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,759
launched a series of workshops and

178
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,840
webinars to help advance the african

179
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,639
coding and research communities which

180
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,560
bioconductor took part in also

181
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,400
these again are just a few of the many

182
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,479
workshops webinars and training

183
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,479
opportunities launched around the world

184
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,800
throughout the year and we are really

185
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,280
excited to see that the bioconnector

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,360
community is growing and that we can be

187
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,360
a part of research worldwide

188
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,120
so those are some great resources to

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,639
connect to the community but now i want

190
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,400
to take it back to this slide on

191
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,960
organization just for a second because

192
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,759
we skipped over the last entry the core

193
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,599
team

194
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,680
the core team plays a vital role in the

195
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680
functionality of the project it's a

196
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,840
small dedicated group of developers that

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,360
help develop maintain and enhance core

198
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,880
packages and project level

199
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,560
infrastructure

200
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,319
so what does that really mean i get the

201
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,000
feeling that most people think that the

202
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,560
core team only takes care of core

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,880
packages and package maintenance but we

204
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,560
really do so much more than that we

205
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,120
talked about bioconductor being a

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,720
project there's a lot of infrastructure

207
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
pieces that are in place to make the

208
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,280
project function so thinking about the

209
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,039
resources we just went over what core

210
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,919
infrastructure is involved that the core

211
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,919
team maintains

212
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
so first there's the main website

213
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,680
bioconductor.org

214
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
the core team is responsible for updates

215
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,440
and website upkeep there's an entire

216
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,599
code base for the website and the

217
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,120
website is regenerated about every 20

218
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,280
minutes to make sure that there is

219
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
constant up-to-date information

220
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,280
similarly there's a code base for the

221
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,360
support site website we thankfully have

222
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,680
support and help from the biostars that

223
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,680
our support site is modeled after and in

224
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,479
particular an attay that assists but we

225
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,800
still have core team involvement in the

226
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,560
upkeep and maintenance of that site

227
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
there's also monitoring and answering

228
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,319
questions that appear on the community

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,319
slack channels many times resulting in

230
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,160
follow-up and investigation of issues

231
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,000
comments and concerns

232
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,759
and many core team members participate

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,039
in presenting material for conferences

234
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,800
and workshops

235
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,039
there's also normally components of the

236
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,440
conference like specialized web pages

237
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,919
systems for hosting workshops and having

238
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,919
computer environments for participants

239
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,320
that the core team also helps manage and

240
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,839
facilitate so hopefully you can already

241
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,519
see the importance of this back-end

242
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,200
infrastructure so continuing on i want

243
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,399
to think about bioconductor from two

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,240
perspectives a user and a developer and

245
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
along the way we'll discuss additional

246
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
important project infrastructure that

247
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,160
the core team helps develop maintain and

248
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,519
enhance to try to provide a good

249
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,519
experience to the community

250
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,959
so thinking about a user how does a user

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,720
interact with bioconductor traditionally

252
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,959
i think most users were using our

253
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,360
terminal or rstudio which is still

254
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
highly popular and widely utilized but

255
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
there are also newer available

256
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,480
technologies and projects like using

257
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,080
docker images or cloud-based initiatives

258
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,920
like the anvil project that allow a

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,000
different user experience

260
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,399
for our terminal and rstudio users

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,399
there's a cram package bioc manager that

262
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,320
is downloaded installed from cran and

263
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,880
provides access to all packages in

264
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,880
bioconductor and crayon repositories the

265
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,360
anvil which stands for analysis

266
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,959
visualization and informative lab space

267
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,560
is an nhgri project it provides a secure

268
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,880
cloud-based computing environment for

269
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,640
analysis i will not go into detail here

270
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,800
about anvil and docker images but i

271
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
encourage everyone to attend natashas

272
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,560
talk where i believe some of these

273
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,560
concepts and resources will be covered i

274
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,240
will mention that the anvil bioconductor

275
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,160
package provides a different install

276
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,560
function designed specifically for use

277
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,640
with the bioconductor docker images and

278
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,600
the anvil computing space that can

279
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,279
provide fast binary package installation

280
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,440
why is this significant well some

281
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,839
packages require compilation which can

282
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
take several seconds package binaries

283
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
are pre-compiled allowing for a near

284
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,680
instantaneous installation the

285
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,519
limitation of binaries is that package

286
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,880
binaries are specific to the system

287
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,560
configuration to which they were

288
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,839
generated which is why they're only

289
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,839
available for use with the docker

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,680
another important concept for users

291
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,320
especially new users is how to find

292
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,000
packages of interest in bios manager

293
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
there's a function available that shows

294
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
a listing of all available packages or

295
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,640
you could use a search term to find

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,279
packages but that assumes some a priori

297
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,200
knowledge the bioc views page and

298
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,519
package landing pages can be really

299
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,760
useful for finding packages

300
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,600
off the bioconductor.org home page

301
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,160
there's a link to available software

302
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,079
packages this takes you to what we call

303
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,560
our bioseed views page and includes

304
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,680
software annotation experiment and

305
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,279
workflow packages books are coming soon

306
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,480
you can either search for terms of

307
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,640
interest like single cell or proteomics

308
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,640
to get a list of packages or if you know

309
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,880
a package name you can search for it

310
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,720
specifically like genomic ranges or

311
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,959
summarized experiment

312
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
the rank ordering is in order of most

313
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,120
downloaded to lease downloaded and if

314
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,920
you click on a package name it takes you

315
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,320
to a bioconductor's package landing page

316
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,560
the page has badges to indicate package

317
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,920
health and information on the package

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,600
like the description documentation what

319
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,360
package dependencies or reverse

320
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,440
dependencies there are

321
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,680
and in the bottom a link to download the

322
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,839
package directly instead of through bioc

323
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,399
manager access to the code base in

324
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,800
git.bioconductor.org

325
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,640
and package download statistics

326
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,120
probably the most helpful on this page

327
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
is the package documentation that a user

328
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,560
can browse through before downloading a

329
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,040
package to see if it's appropriate for

330
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,040
their type of analysis

331
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,839
so before switching to a developer's

332
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,079
point of view let's revisit the core

333
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,000
team and in these few concepts for users

334
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,279
what sort of infrastructure is required

335
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,639
in the background

336
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,279
so there's obviously some package

337
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,000
maintenance with regard to bioc manager

338
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,160
anvil anvil specific packages and

339
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,079
bioseat views packages

340
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,240
there's a concept of a daily build of

341
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,760
all bioconductor packages so that

342
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,920
they're available through the bioc

343
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,920
manager install function

344
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,560
there's generation and upkeep of docker

345
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,800
images so bioconductor docker images for

346
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,880
both release and develop branches and an

347
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,600
anvil specific docker image that needs

348
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,200
to be submitted to the anvil platform

349
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
there's also the binary package

350
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,000
generation for those provide packages

351
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,360
provided through anvil install

352
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,040
and then there's the website code and

353
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,279
website interaction so that you could

354
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,519
see that biosea views page and package

355
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,360
landing pages and the constant

356
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,519
regeneration of the website to make sure

357
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,440
that all that information stays up to

358
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,720
date to the latest

359
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,720
and then at the bottom of the packing

360
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,560
landing pages i mentioned it briefly but

361
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,600
there's package download statistics that

362
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,279
get calculated for each package as well

363
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
so again hopefully that you can see

364
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,760
while it may seem like trivial and basic

365
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,440
functionality that there's a lot that

366
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,360
needs to be in place behind the scenes

367
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,320
for everything to function properly and

368
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,320
interact properly

369
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,560
so the core team has a subset of

370
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,040
packages that are considered core

371
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,200
packages and core team maintained but

372
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,880
most of the packages in bioconductor are

373
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,480
community contributed

374
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,920
anyone from the community is welcome to

375
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,399
develop and submit a package to

376
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,920
bioconductor there are certain specific

377
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,760
package requirements that should be

378
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,160
implemented when developing and a

379
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,240
package will undergo a review process

380
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,399
once a package is accepted then it's

381
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,320
added to the daily builder and available

382
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,320
through bioc manager install

383
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,160
so package specific requirements can be

384
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,000
found at contributions.bioconnector.org

385
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,480
and the developer section of the main

386
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,240
website we are in the process of moving

387
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,600
information from the developer section

388
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,480
of the website to the

389
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,399
contributions.bioconductor.org location

390
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,399
so eventually all the information will

391
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,160
be in one location

392
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,160
but let's go over some of the key

393
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,000
concepts that should be implemented when

394
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,160
developing a package

395
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,720
one of the main things is reusing or

396
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,800
extending existing classes and using the

397
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,360
well-developed import and export methods

398
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,680
for certain data types bioconductor has

399
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,839
the concept of interoperability so if a

400
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,600
user wants to use one package to import

401
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,079
a different normalize and a third to

402
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,240
visualize the manipulation of data from

403
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,800
one package to the next should be

404
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,600
minimal if not eliminated completely for

405
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,760
the user so ideally the output of one

406
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,000
should be the input to another

407
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,839
this is why we like to emphasize using

408
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,199
or extending any of the existing class

409
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,360
structures another good practice worth

410
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,079
mentioning is the caching of web-based

411
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,880
data when possible this way if a user is

412
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,040
without internet or requests the same

413
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,600
file from a website or a website is

414
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,399
temporary unavailable they don't have to

415
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,320
re-download and could potentially use a

416
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,160
previously downloaded version instead of

417
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,240
having to wait for the internet or

418
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,000
re-download data

419
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,560
another good practice is implementing

420
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,279
unit tests it's strongly recommended

421
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,360
while tests can seem burdensome if added

422
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,680
to the development process early it can

423
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,000
actually aid in development so testing

424
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,920
for things like edge cases and having

425
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
both positive and negative tests can

426
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,760
ensure proper proper functionality

427
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,680
biggest thing that bioconductor is also

428
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,759
going to insist upon is a really

429
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,240
detailed vignette with runnable code

430
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,399
examples so vignettes are compiled when

431
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,040
built so it can also help ensure proper

432
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,120
functioning code but we like detailed

433
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,560
vignettes because ideally this gives

434
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,399
your users

435
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,160
an understanding of the package and the

436
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,160
unique functionality that the package

437
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,920
provides and these are just a few

438
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,160
concepts of the many that you'll find on

439
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,160
this

440
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,160
contributions.bioconductor.org page

441
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
so once a package is developed a user

442
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,079
then submits to the bioconductor new

443
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,680
submission tracker on github

444
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,600
there's some useful information on the

445
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,160
home page about what to expect and how

446
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,720
to submit related or dependent packages

447
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,560
but to submit a new issue you go to open

448
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,720
a new issue under bioconductor

449
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,079
contributions the title should be your

450
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,320
package name

451
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,639
all packages currently require a github

452
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,120
repository location and the link should

453
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,440
be updated pointing to this location

454
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,399
a package then is an awaiting moderation

455
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,079
stage

456
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,880
a reviewer will be assigned and the

457
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,000
package added to our

458
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,560
get.bioconductor.org location and a

459
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,199
build triggered on all three major os

460
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,519
platforms linux mac and windows

461
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,920
once a package is building and checking

462
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,839
without error the reviewer will do an

463
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,160
in-depth review of the package and offer

464
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,920
comments suggestions or request changes

465
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,199
consistent with bioconductor package

466
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,040
requirements

467
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,959
there's an open dialogue in the review

468
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,800
process open to the community and

469
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,839
governed by the bioconductor code of

470
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,160
conduct

471
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,759
once a package is accepted it's added to

472
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,759
the nightly daily builder

473
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,959
bioconductor uses get for version

474
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,079
control of package source code

475
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:09,520
bioconductor builds only from

476
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,600
get.bioconductor.org and users must push

477
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,039
changes to this location to propagate

478
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,280
them to users

479
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,839
from a few times a week to daily the

480
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,319
bioconductor builders will do a get

481
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,799
clone a version of the package and then

482
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,799
do an r command install r command build

483
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,959
and r command check

484
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,120
if the package installs builds and

485
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,039
checks cleanly and has a valid version

486
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,960
bump for changes the package is

487
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,600
propagated and becomes available through

488
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,440
the bioc manager install function

489
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,360
maintainers can find the build reports

490
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,080
from the main website in the lower right

491
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,080
corner marked build reports this page

492
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
indicates how frequently the builds take

493
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,360
place

494
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,440
if we click on browse for any of the

495
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,080
build reports you'll get a list of every

496
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,480
bioconductor package and the status

497
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,480
through each stage the top of the page

498
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,640
has a time stamp to indicate when it was

499
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,200
generated and each package has

500
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,200
information on the version git commit

501
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,559
and get date that the builder used for

502
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,640
that report

503
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,840
you can click on any stage indicator for

504
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,600
more information and results

505
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,160
so what infrastructure is needed for

506
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,600
everything just discussed for submitting

507
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
a package

508
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,679
well there's evaluating and updating of

509
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,600
the package guidelines

510
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,000
there's the code that interacts with the

511
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,840
package submission process on github and

512
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,520
code specific to the new submission

513
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,960
process on each of the three develop

514
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,640
builders

515
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,320
the core team also participates

516
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,480
currently in package reviews for new

517
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,320
submissions

518
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,720
there is facilitating the entire

519
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,840
bioconductor get ecosystem which

520
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,960
includes the

521
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,799
get.bioconductor.org main repository

522
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,760
location for all of the bioconductor

523
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:51,120
packages a git contributions app that

524
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,520
manages ssh credentials of users

525
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,360
get a light application that manages

526
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,840
which users have access to which

527
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,760
packages and gut hooks that respond to

528
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,520
different triggering events

529
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,480
there's also the bioconductor build

530
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,480
system called the bbs which is a large

531
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,559
undertaking of the core team there are

532
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,640
minimally six build machines that

533
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,200
require system administration and the

534
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,679
underlying code base on each to handle

535
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,919
the get clone the r command install the

536
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,000
r command build the r command check the

537
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,600
package propagation and the generation

538
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,760
of the build reports

539
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,440
and there's minimally six builders

540
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,000
because for both the bioconductor

541
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,640
release and bioconductor devel branches

542
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,559
we cover the three main os platforms of

543
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,559
mac linux and windows

544
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,200
so briefly i wanted to also touch upon

545
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,760
why bioconductor has a release in a

546
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,520
devel branch bioconductor is closely

547
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,320
associated with r

548
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,320
most years in spring r has a release

549
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,559
bioconductor then needs to update which

550
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,160
version of r is being used for packages

551
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,520
to insured continued proper

552
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,080
functionality

553
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,600
bioconductor has two releases of gear a

554
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,080
spring and a fall

555
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,919
where the devel branch is released and

556
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,200
becomes the new release

557
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,600
from roughly late april and early may

558
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,520
when the new version of r is released

559
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,000
both the bioconductor release and devel

560
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,559
branch use that stapled release version

561
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,200
of r or our patched version

562
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,440
in fall normally late october early

563
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,400
november bioconductor does a second

564
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,559
release

565
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,200
at this time the bioconductor release

566
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,360
branch still uses that stable rr patch

567
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,600
version but the devel bioconductor

568
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,600
branch switches to use r devel in

569
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,799
preparation for the next r release in

570
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,039
spring

571
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,919
having a devel branch allows maintainers

572
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,159
to adapt to changes in base r as well as

573
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,799
changes in any other dependent packages

574
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,840
that they may have and then have minimal

575
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,440
disruption or downtime to the end user

576
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,360
bioconductor encourage package

577
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,520
maintainers to enhance and make major

578
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
changes on the development branch and

579
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,159
restrict changes on the release branch

580
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,600
to minor bug corrections again also

581
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,600
reasoning that there would be a place

582
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,120
for development and potential breakage

583
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,960
without affecting the end users

584
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,559
the core team is always extremely busy

585
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,799
during release time and with release

586
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,960
related tasks it involves updating

587
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,440
versions of r and bioconductor on

588
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,120
minimumly the six builders

589
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
emailing maintainers that ignored the

590
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
build failure notifications to try and

591
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,280
fix their packages to avoid deprecation

592
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,360
and removal from bioconductor

593
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,760
reviewing the influx of newly submitted

594
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,840
packages for inclusion

595
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,400
fixing or modifying any core packages

596
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,360
that require such attention adding

597
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,320
release related annotation resources

598
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,039
creating new branches on

599
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,039
get.bioconductor.org for all the

600
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,120
packages for the new release

601
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,799
and collating all the news files from

602
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,280
packages to generate the release

603
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,200
announcement

604
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,039
there is another key infrastructure

605
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,120
piece that the core team maintains that

606
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,280
has gained increasing popularity in

607
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,600
recent years the concept of the

608
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,039
bioconductor hubs annotation hub and

609
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,919
experiment hub

610
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,880
as a brief background git does not allow

611
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,760
large files and our current git system

612
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,600
does not support get lfs which means

613
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,240
there has to be an alternative way to

614
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,400
provide large data sets to users

615
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,880
bioconductor insists data to be hosted

616
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,559
on a secure public or institutional

617
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,440
server like zenodo amazon s3 buckets

618
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,559
microsoft azure among other trusted

619
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,679
sites or direct access to web resources

620
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,120
or databases if available like ensemble

621
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,600
or ncbi

622
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,159
rather than privately hosting data on

623
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,760
say a github or dropbox

624
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
if you're developing a package we

625
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,760
encourage a discussion about data

626
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,120
hosting on other platforms on the

627
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,480
bioslee

628
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,799
dash devel

629
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,799
r-projects.org developers mailing list

630
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,760
if a maintainer does not have access to

631
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,400
such a resource bioconductor provides an

632
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,960
amazon s3 bucket for use

633
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,320
we are however actively investigating a

634
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,480
migration of location from amazon s3 to

635
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,400
microsoft azure

636
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,720
developers can download resources

637
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,200
directly from the trusted sites

638
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,120
but must implement a caching mechanism

639
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,600
in the background and we highly

640
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,919
recommend the bioconductor core package

641
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,760
bioc file cache

642
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,080
the other alternative to downloading

643
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,159
directly and implementing bios you file

644
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,720
cache is to list the data in the

645
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,640
annotation hub or experiment hub

646
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,880
the annotation hub and the experiment

647
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,960
hub are databases with references to the

648
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,440
external data for download

649
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,840
the hub interfaces provide a querying

650
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,720
mechanism on metadata provided at

651
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,320
inclusion of the data into the database

652
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,279
when using the hub interface for

653
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,600
download it already uses bioc file cache

654
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,320
as a caching mechanism so a maintainer

655
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,320
does not have to implement it themselves

656
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,320
the other advantage to listing the data

657
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,960
in the hubs is the findability of

658
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,120
resources outside of r or outside the

659
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,640
use of the associated bioconductor

660
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,480
package

661
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,720
there are bioconductor core packages

662
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,400
experiment hub and annotation hub that

663
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,480
can be queried for data of different

664
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,400
types or from different sources

665
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,799
the resources can be searched either

666
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,600
through a query performed within r or

667
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,159
investigation through the hub apis and

668
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,120
annotationhub.bioconductor.org or

669
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,679
experimenthub.bioconductor

670
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,159
the api is admittedly a little crude and

671
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,640
we are working on a revamp there's also

672
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,240
a shiny version to query hub resources

673
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,760
that has been developed and should be

674
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,159
announced soon

675
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,480
the query function in r will take a list

676
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,200
of terms and return resources matching

677
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,360
search criteria for example you can see

678
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,400
we queried here for ensembl gtf release

679
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,520
103 and homo sapiens which returned four

680
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,919
results

681
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,080
a single bracket using the ahid of

682
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,480
interest will give more information on

683
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,520
the resource and a double bracket will

684
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,840
download and cache the resource

685
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,240
the requirement to add data to the hubs

686
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,640
is a package that is already or will be

687
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,240
submitted to bioconductor that includes

688
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,240
an inst metadata.csv file with metadata

689
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,679
for the resources that will be added to

690
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,000
the database

691
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,400
and an in-script directory with files

692
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,120
that indicate how the data was generated

693
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,760
and relevant source information

694
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,240
the vignette creating a hub package

695
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,279
experiment hub or annotation hub in the

696
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,799
core package hub pub describes this in

697
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,640
more detail

698
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,520
other questions can be directed to the

699
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,440
hubs at bioconductor.org email

700
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,600
the hubs currently involve a lot of

701
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,200
interaction from the core team we are

702
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,600
working on making enhancements and

703
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,600
restructure to try to make it simpler

704
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,799
and easier to submit and maintain hub

705
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,720
data with limited core team interaction

706
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,960
currently when data is submitted to the

707
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,279
hubs a core team member will evaluate

708
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,600
the data and metadata provided

709
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,159
if needed assist with uploading data to

710
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,480
the bioconductor provided location again

711
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,159
currently that's an amazon s3 bucket but

712
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,320
that could change

713
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,640
and update the database for the metadata

714
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,880
provided so the metadata is available

715
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,279
through the query functions

716
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,000
additionally core team maintenance of

717
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,039
the hubs includes managing server code

718
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,159
on the amazon web service ec2 instances

719
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,799
that hosts the website and api endpoints

720
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,840
for both hubs and general core package

721
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,159
maintenance of the relevant core

722
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,960
packages experiment hub annotation hub

723
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,880
bioc file cache experiment hub data

724
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,880
annotation hub data and hubpub

725
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,480
so there are still other core related

726
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
tasks and infrastructure that we just

727
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,880
haven't had time to touch on things like

728
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,919
the amazon web service resources that we

729
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,279
utilize and the microsoft azure project

730
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,240
resources

731
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,720
but

732
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,480
hopefully this gave everyone an idea of

733
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,559
how much the core team supports in

734
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,840
addition to just general core package

735
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,600
health and development

736
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,440
so with that i would like to thank the

737
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,600
conference organizers for inviting me to

738
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,000
speak it really has been an honor and

739
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,400
thank you to my fellow core team members

740
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,159
i appreciate all the work and effort we

741
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
all put into keeping the project moving

742
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,279
forward

743
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,520
and most of all a thank you to the

744
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,279
bioconductor community bioconductor

745
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,679
would not be successful without the

746
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,159
contributions of all of you and whether

747
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,000
you're a first time user or a long-time

748
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,200
contributor we really hope that you

749
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,279
found a welcoming and helpful community
