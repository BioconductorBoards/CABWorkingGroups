# The minimum requirements of Bioconductor events

As of May 2021, "events" are assumed to be "virtual events" only.


## Host Checklist (Community events related to Bioconductor)

- [ ] Have a Bioconductor focus or be of interest to bioconductor users/developers
- [ ] Contacting to workshop@bioconductor.org before at least 2weeks in advance.
- [ ] Determining the date and time

## Host Checklist (BioC)

- [ ] Ensure all participants have access to read and accept [the code of conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/). Have a mechanism in place to report and address CoC issues.
- [ ] Website for the event
- [ ]  Promote diversity and inclusion, including ensure gender balance of invited speakers
- [ ] Sharing of materials eg slides or recording video of the event and sharing the video using [the Bioconductor YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor)
- [ ] Workshops use https://github.com/seandavi/BuildABiocWorkshop as the template
- [ ] Contacting to workshop@bioconductor.org before at least 2-4months in advance.

### Considerations

- Is there a requirement to have a member of the bioconductor community in the organizing committee
- What if the event is local (within institute, or local to an area... eg the Boston Bioconductor meetup)?
- Provide advance notice (what is the advance notice period)
- Do we just want non-profit events or are Commercial events included?
- What about social or after conference events.
