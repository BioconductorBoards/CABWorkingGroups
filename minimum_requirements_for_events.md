# The minimum requirements of Bioconductor events

As of April 2021, "events" are assumed to be "virtual events" only.

## Host Checklist

- [ ] Have a Bioconductor focus or be of interest to bioconductor users/developers
- [ ] Ensure all participants have access to read and accept the code of conduct. Have a mechanism in place to report and address CoC issues.


### Considerations

- Is there a requirement to have a member of the bioconductor community in the organizing committee
- What is the event is local (within institute, or local to an area... eg the Boston Bioconductor meetup)?
- Provide advance notice (what is the advance notice period)
- Do we just want non-profit events or are Commercial events included?
- What about social or after conference events.
