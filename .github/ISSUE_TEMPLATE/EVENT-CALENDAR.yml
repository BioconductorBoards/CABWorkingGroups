        Submit this form and your event will be listed on the bioconductor.org calendar.
        Please review the following minimum requirements before submitting this form:
        
          1. Having a Bioconductor focus or be of interest to Bioconductor users/developers.
          2. The event organizer should (read and) confirm the [Bioconductor Code of Conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/).
          3. The event organizer should specify a Code of Conduct (CoC) derived from the partner organization or the [Bioconductor Code of Conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/).
          4. The event organizer should summarise the CoC. (The event participants might not have time to read the CoC in a busy class, so it is good to take some time out.)
